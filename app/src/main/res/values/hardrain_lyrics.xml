    I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 Well, I wake in the morning\n
 Fold my hands and pray for rain\n
 I got a head full of ideas\n
 That are drivin’ me insane\n
 It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor\n
 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n
 Well, he hands you a nickel\n
 He hands you a dime\n
 He asks you with a grin\n
 If you’re havin’ a good time\n
 Then he fines you every time you slam the door\n
 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n
 Well, he puts his cigar\n
 Out in your face just for kicks\n
 His bedroom window\n
 It is made out of bricks\n
 The National Guard stands around his door\n
 Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n
 Well, she talks to all the servants\n
 About man and God and law\n
 Everybody says\n
 She’s the brains behind pa\n
 She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four\n
 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 Well, I try my best\n
 To be just like I am\n
 But everybody wants you\n
 To be just like them\n
 They sing while you slave and I just get bored\n
 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n

    Down the street the dogs are barkin’\n
 And the day is a-gettin’ dark\n
 As the night comes in a-fallin’\n
 The dogs’ll lose their bark\n
 An’ the silent night will shatter\n
 From the sounds inside my mind\n
 For I’m one too many mornings\n
 And a thousand miles behind\n

 From the crossroads of my doorstep\n
 My eyes they start to fade\n
 As I turn my head back to the room\n
 Where my love and I have laid\n
 An’ I gaze back to the street\n
 The sidewalk and the sign\n
 And I’m one too many mornings\n
 An’ a thousand miles behind\n

 It’s a restless hungry feeling\n
 That don’t mean no one no good\n
 When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’\n
 You can say it just as good.\n
 You’re right from your side\n
 I’m right from mine\n
 We’re both just one too many mornings\n
 An’ a thousand miles behind\n

        Oh, the ragman draws circles\n
 Up and down the block\n
 I’d ask him what the matter was\n
 But I know that he don’t talk\n
 And the ladies treat me kindly\n
 And furnish me with tape\n
 But deep inside my heart\n
 I know I can’t escape\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley\n
 With his pointed shoes and his bells\n
 Speaking to some French girl\n
 Who says she knows me well\n
 And I would send a message\n
 To find out if she’s talked\n
 But the post office has been stolen\n
 And the mailbox is locked\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Mona tried to tell me\n
 To stay away from the train line\n
 She said that all the railroad men\n
 Just drink up your blood like wine\n
 An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that\n
 But then again, there’s only one I’ve met\n
 An’ he just smoked my eyelids\n
 An’ punched my cigarette”\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Grandpa died last week\n
 And now he’s buried in the rocks\n
 But everybody still talks about\n
 How badly they were shocked\n
 But me, I expected it to happen\n
 I knew he’d lost control\n
 When he built a fire on Main Street\n
 And shot it full of holes\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Now the senator came down here\n
 Showing ev’ryone his gun\n
 Handing out free tickets\n
 To the wedding of his son\n
 An’ me, I nearly got busted\n
 An’ wouldn’t it be my luck\n
 To get caught without a ticket\n
 And be discovered beneath a truck\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Now the preacher looked so baffled\n
 When I asked him why he dressed\n
 With twenty pounds of headlines\n
 Stapled to his chest\n
 But he cursed me when I proved it to him\n
 Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide\n
 You see, you’re just like me\n
 I hope you’re satisfied”\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Now the rainman gave me two cures\n
 Then he said, “Jump right in”\n
 The one was Texas medicine\n
 The other was just railroad gin\n
 An’ like a fool I mixed them\n
 An’ it strangled up my mind\n
 An’ now people just get uglier\n
 An’ I have no sense of time\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 When Ruthie says come see her\n
 In her honky-tonk lagoon\n
 Where I can watch her waltz for free\n
 ’Neath her Panamanian moon\n
 An’ I say, “Aw come on now\n
 You must know about my debutante”\n
 An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need\n
 But I know what you want”\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street\n
 Where the neon madmen climb\n
 They all fall there so perfectly\n
 It all seems so well timed\n
 An’ here I sit so patiently\n
 Waiting to find out what price\n
 You have to pay to get out of\n
 Going through all these things twice\n
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\n
 To be stuck inside of Mobile\n
 With the Memphis blues again\n

        Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms\n
 You should not treat me like a stranger\n
 Our Father would not like the way that you act\n
 And you must realize the danger\n

 Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you\n
 And one deserving of affection?\n
 And is our purpose not the same on this earth\n
 To love and follow His direction?\n

 We grew up together\n
 From the cradle to the grave\n
 We died and were reborn\n
 And then mysteriously saved\n

 Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door\n
 Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow\n
 Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore\n
 You may not see me tomorrow\n

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Whatever colors you have in your mind\n
 I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine\n

 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile\n
 Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile\n
 His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean\n
 And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen\n

 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile\n
 Why wait any longer for the world to begin\n
 You can have your cake and eat it too\n
 Why wait any longer for the one you love\n
 When he’s standing in front of you\n

 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead\n
 I long to see you in the morning light\n
 I long to reach for you in the night\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead\n

’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood\n
 When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud\n
 I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured\n
 I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word\n
 In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved\n
 Everything up to that point had been left unresolved\n
 Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail\n
 Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail\n
 Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there\n
 With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair\n
 She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost\n
 I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed\n
 Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount\n
 But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts\n
 And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove\n
 And old men with broken teeth stranded without love\n
 Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\n
 I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\n
 I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

 Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line\n
 Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine\n
 If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n

    <string name="yourareabiggrilnowlyrics">
Our conversation was short and sweet\n
 It nearly swept me off-a my feet\n
 And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh\n
 And you are on dry land\n
 You made it there somehow\n
 You’re a big girl now\n

 Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence\n
 He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense\n
 And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh\n
 Singin’ just for you\n
 I hope that you can hear\n
 Hear me singin’ through these tears\n

 Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast\n
 Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last\n
 I can change, I swear, oh, oh\n
 See what you can do\n
 I can make it through\n
 You can make it too\n

 Love is so simple, to quote a phrase\n
 You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days\n
 Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\n
 In somebody’s room\n
 It’s a price I have to pay\n
 You’re a big girl all the way\n

 A change in the weather is known to be extreme\n
 But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\n
 I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh\n
 With a pain that stops and starts\n
 Like a corkscrew to my heart\n
 Ever since we’ve been apart\n

I once held her in my arms\n
 She said she would always stay\n
 But I was cruel\n
 I treated her like a fool\n
 I threw it all away\n

 Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand\n
 And rivers that ran through ev’ry day\n
 I must have been mad\n
 I never knew what I had\n
 Until I threw it all away\n

 Love is all there is, it makes the world go ’round\n
 Love and only love, it can’t be denied\n
 No matter what you think about it\n
 You just won’t be able to do without it\n
 Take a tip from one who’s tried\n

 So if you find someone that gives you all of her love\n
 Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray\n
 For one thing that’s certain\n
 You will surely be a-hurtin’\n
 If you throw it all away\n

Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press\n
 Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess\n
 They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy\n
 She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me\n
 I can’t help it if I’m lucky\n

 People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act\n
 Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\n
 Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at\n
 I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that\n
 Sweet lady\n

 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth\n
 Blowing down the backroads headin’ south\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n

 I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\n
 I haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like\n
 There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door\n
 You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\n
 After losin’ every battle\n

 I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are\n
 Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars\n
 You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies\n
 One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes\n
 Blood on your saddle\n

 Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb\n
 Blowing through the curtains in your room\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n

 It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\n
 You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart\n
 Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped\n
 What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top\n
 You’re on the bottom\n

 I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\n
 I can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\n
     don’t look into mine\n
 The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the\n
     building burned\n
 I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the\n
     springtime turned\n
 Slowly into Autumn\n

 Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull\n
 From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n

 I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read\n
 Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead\n
 Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy\n
 I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\n
 And all your ragin’ glory\n

 I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free\n
 I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me\n
 You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above\n
 And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love\n
 And it makes me feel so sorry\n

 Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats\n
 Blowing through the letters that we wrote\n
 Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves\n
 We’re idiots, babe\n
 It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves\n
