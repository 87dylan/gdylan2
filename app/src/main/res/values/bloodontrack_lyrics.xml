        Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’\n
 I was layin’ in bed\n
 Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all\n
 If her hair was still red\n
 Her folks they said our lives together\n
 Sure was gonna be rough\n
 They never did like Mama’s homemade dress\n
 Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough\n
 And I was standin’ on the side of the road\n
 Rain fallin’ on my shoes\n
 Heading out for the East Coast\n
 Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through\n
 Tangled up in blue\n

 She was married when we first met\n
 Soon to be divorced\n
 I helped her out of a jam, I guess\n
 But I used a little too much force\n
 We drove that car as far as we could\n
 Abandoned it out West\n
 Split up on a dark sad night\n
 Both agreeing it was best\n
 She turned around to look at me\n
 As I was walkin’ away\n
 I heard her say over my shoulder\n
 “We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”\n
 Tangled up in blue\n

 I had a job in the great north woods\n
 Working as a cook for a spell\n
 But I never did like it all that much\n
 And one day the ax just fell\n
 So I drifted down to New Orleans\n
 Where I happened to be employed\n
 Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat\n
 Right outside of Delacroix\n
 But all the while I was alone\n
 The past was close behind\n
 I seen a lot of women\n
 But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\n
 Tangled up in blue\n

 She was workin’ in a topless place\n
 And I stopped in for a beer\n
 I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face\n
 In the spotlight so clear\n
 And later on as the crowd thinned out\n
 I’s just about to do the same\n
 She was standing there in back of my chair\n
 Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”\n
 I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath\n
 She studied the lines on my face\n
 I must admit I felt a little uneasy\n
 When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe\n
 Tangled up in blue\n

 She lit a burner on the stove\n
 And offered me a pipe\n
 “I thought you’d never say hello,” she said\n
 “You look like the silent type”\n
 Then she opened up a book of poems\n
 And handed it to me\n
 Written by an Italian poet\n
 From the thirteenth century\n
 And every one of them words rang true\n
 And glowed like burnin’ coal\n
 Pourin’ off of every page\n
 Like it was written in my soul from me to you\n
 Tangled up in blue\n
 I lived with them on Montague Street\n
 In a basement down the stairs\n
 There was music in the cafés at night\n
 And revolution in the air\n
 Then he started into dealing with slaves\n
 And something inside of him died\n
 She had to sell everything she owned\n
 And froze up inside\n
 And when finally the bottom fell out\n
 I became withdrawn\n
 The only thing I knew how to do\n
 Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew\n
 Tangled up in blue\n
 So now I’m goin’ back again\n
 I got to get to her somehow\n
 All the people we used to know\n
 They’re an illusion to me now\n
 Some are mathematicians\n
 Some are carpenters’ wives\n
 Don’t know how it all got started\n
 I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives\n
 But me, I’m still on the road\n
 Headin’ for another joint\n
 We always did feel the same\n
 We just saw it from a different point of view\n
 Tangled up in blue\n

        They sat together in the park\n
 As the evening sky grew dark\n
 She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones\n
 ’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight\n
 And watched out for a simple twist of fate\n
 They walked along by the old canal\n
 A little confused, I remember well\n
 And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright\n
 He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\n
 Moving with a simple twist of fate\n
 A saxophone someplace far off played\n
 As she was walkin’ by the arcade\n
 As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,\n
 She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\n
 And forgot about a simple twist of fate\n
 He woke up, the room was bare\n
 He didn’t see her anywhere\n
 He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide\n
 Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\n
 Brought on by a simple twist of fate\n
 He hears the ticking of the clocks\n
 And walks along with a parrot that talks\n
 Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in\n
 Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait\n
 Once more for a simple twist of fate\n
 People tell me it’s a sin\n
 To know and feel too much within\n
 I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring\n
 She was born in spring, but I was born too late\n
 Blame it on a simple twist of fate\n

    Our conversation was short and sweet\n
 It nearly swept me off-a my feet\n
 And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh\n
 And you are on dry land\n
 You made it there somehow\n
 You’re a big girl now\n
 Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence\n
 He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense\n
 And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh\n
 Singin’ just for you\n
 I hope that you can hear\n
 Hear me singin’ through these tears\n
 Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast\n
 Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last\n
 I can change, I swear, oh, oh\n
 See what you can do\n
 I can make it through\n
 You can make it too\n
 Love is so simple, to quote a phrase\n
 You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days\n
 Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\n
 In somebody’s room\n
 It’s a price I have to pay\n
 You’re a big girl all the way\n
 A change in the weather is known to be extreme\n
 But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\n
 I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh\n
 With a pain that stops and starts\n
 Like a corkscrew to my heart\n
 Ever since we’ve been apart\n

    <string name="idiotwindlyrics_blood">
      Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press\n
 Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess\n
 They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy\n
 She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me\n
 I can’t help it if I’m lucky\n
 People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act\n
 Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\n
 Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at\n
 I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that\n
 Sweet lady\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth\n
 Blowing down the backroads headin’ south\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n
 I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\n
 I haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like\n
 There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door\n
 You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\n
 After losin’ every battle\n
 I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are\n
 Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars\n
 You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies\n
 One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes\n
 Blood on your saddle\n
 Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb\n
 Blowing through the curtains in your room\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n
 It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\n
 You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart\n
 Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped\n
 What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top\n
 You’re on the bottom\n
 I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\n
 I can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\n
     don’t look into mine\n
 The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the\n
     building burned\n
 I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the\n
     springtime turned\n
 Slowly into Autumn\n
 Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull\n
 From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\n
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\n
 You’re an idiot, babe\n
 It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\n
 I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read\n
 Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead\n
 Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy\n
 I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\n
 And all your ragin’ glory\n
 I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free\n
 I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me\n
 You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above\n
 And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love\n
 And it makes me feel so sorry\n
 Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats\n
 Blowing through the letters that we wrote\n
 Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves\n
 We’re idiots, babe\n
 It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves\n

        I’ve seen love go by my door\n
 It’s never been this close before\n
 Never been so easy or so slow\n
 Been shooting in the dark too long\n
 When somethin’s not right it’s wrong\n
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go\n
 Dragon clouds so high above\n
 I’ve only known careless love\n
 It’s always hit me from below\n
 This time around it’s more correct\n
 Right on target, so direct\n
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go\n
 Purple clover, Queen Anne’s lace\n
 Crimson hair across your face\n
 You could make me cry if you don’t know\n
 Can’t remember what I was thinkin’ of\n
 You might be spoilin’ me too much, love\n
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go\n
 Flowers on the hillside, bloomin’ crazy\n
 Crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme\n
 Blue river runnin’ slow and lazy\n
 I could stay with you forever and never realize the time\n
 Situations have ended sad\n
 Relationships have all been bad\n
 Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud\n
 But there’s no way I can compare\n
 All those scenes to this affair\n
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go\n
 Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’\n
 Stayin’ far behind without you\n
 Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’\n
 Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin’ to\n
 I’ll look for you in old Honolulu\n
 San Francisco, Ashtabula\n
 Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know\n
 But I’ll see you in the sky above\n
 In the tall grass, in the ones I love\n
 Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go\n

 Honey, we could be in Kansas\n
 By time the snow begins to thaw\n
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn\n
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn\n
 But you wouldn’t know it by me\n
 Every day’s been darkness since you been gone\n
 Little rooster crowin’, there must be something on his mind\n
 Little rooster crowin’, there must be something on his mind\n
 Well, I feel just like that rooster\n
 Honey, ya treat me so unkind\n
 The birds are flyin’ low babe, honey I feel so exposed\n
 Well, the birds are flyin’ low babe, honey I feel so exposed\n
 Well now, I ain’t got any matches\n
 And the station doors are closed\n
 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above\n
 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above\n
 Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs\n
 Honey, you know I’ve earned your love\n
 Look at the sun sinkin’ like a ship\n
 Look at the sun sinkin’ like a ship\n
 Ain’t that just like my heart, babe\n
 When you kissed my lips?\n

The festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall\n
 The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall\n
 The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down\n
 Anyone with any sense had already left town\n
 He was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts\n
 He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\n
 Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads\n
 Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\n
 “Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\n
 Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\n
 Backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs\n
 Lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair\n
 Outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide\n
 A gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside\n
 Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\n
 Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine\n
 He made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine\n
 With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\n
 He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\n
 But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\n
 Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\n
 She slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown\n
 She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\n
 “Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear\n
 He was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n
 “I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself\n
 “Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\n
 But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\n
 And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\n
 Starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\n
 Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\n
 She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\n
 She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\n
 With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\n
 But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\n
 The hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\n
 The drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\n
 It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\n
 And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\n
 No, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\n
 Rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife\n
 She was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife\n
 She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\n
 Was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died\n
 She was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\n
 Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\n
 “Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\n
     have known it would someday\n
 Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\n
 I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”\n
 Down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts\n
 The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\n
 “There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\n
 He went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk\n
 As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\n
 There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\n
 Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\n
 She forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much\n
 “I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\n
 But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\n
 Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\n
 No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\n
 The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\n
 And Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised\n
 Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\n
 She was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts\n
 Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\n
 And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\n
 In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\n
 For one more member who had business back in town\n
 But they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\n
 The next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black\n
 Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\n
 And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink\n
 The hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink\n
 The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts\n
 The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\n
 Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\n
 She was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\n
 Thinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law\n
 But most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts\n

        If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\n
 It’s the city ’cross the water, not too far from here\n
 Say for me that I’m all right \n
        though things are kind of slow \n
        She might think that I’ve forgotten her.\n
        Don’t tell her it isn’t so\n
 We had a falling-out, like lovers sometimes do\n
 But to think of how she left that night,\n
        it hurts me through and through\n
        And though our situation pierced me to the bone\n
 I got to find someone to take her place. I don’t like to be alone\n
 I see a lot of people as I make the rounds\n
 And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town \n
 And I’ve never gotten used to it, \n
        I’ve just learned to turn it off Her eyes were blue,\n
        her hair was too, her skin so sweet and soft\n
 Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\n
 I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\n
 If she’s passin’ back this way, and I sure hope she don’t\n
 Tell her she can look me up. I’ll either be here or I won’t\n

        ’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood\n
 When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud\n
 I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured\n
 I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word\n
 In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved\n
 Everything up to that point had been left unresolved\n
 Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail\n
 Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail\n
 Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there\n
 With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair\n
 She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost\n
 I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed\n
 Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount\n
 But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts\n
 And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove\n
 And old men with broken teeth stranded without love\n
 Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\n
 I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\n
 I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
 Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line\n
 Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine\n
 If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born\n
 “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n
