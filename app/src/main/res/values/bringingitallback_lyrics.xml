Johnny’s in the basement\n
 Mixing up the medicine\n
 I’m on the pavement\n
 Thinking about the government\n
 The man in the trench coat\n
 Badge out, laid off\n
 Says he’s got a bad cough\n
 Wants to get it paid off\n
 Look out kid\n
 It’s somethin’ you did\n
 God knows when\n
 But you’re doin’ it again\n
 You better duck down the alley way\n
 Lookin’ for a new friend\n
 The man in the coon-skin cap\n
 By the big pen\n
 Wants eleven dollar bills\n
 You only got ten\n

 Maggie comes fleet foot\n
 Face full of black soot\n
 Talkin’ that the heat put\n
 Plants in the bed but\n
 The phone’s tapped anyway\n
 Maggie says that many say\n
 They must bust in early May\n
 Orders from the D.A.\n
 Look out kid\n
 Don’t matter what you did\n
 Walk on your tiptoes\n
 Don’t try “No-Doz”\n
 Better stay away from those\n
 That carry around a fire hose\n
 Keep a clean nose\n
 Watch the plain clothes\n
 You don’t need a weatherman\n
 To know which way the wind blows\n

 Get sick, get well\n
 Hang around a ink well\n
 Ring bell, hard to tell\n
 If anything is goin’ to sell\n
 Try hard, get barred\n
 Get back, write braille\n
 Get jailed, jump bail\n
 Join the army, if you fail\n
 Look out kid\n
 You’re gonna get hit\n
 But users, cheaters\n
 Six-time losers\n
 Hang around the theaters\n
 Girl by the whirlpool\n
 Lookin’ for a new fool\n
 Don’t follow leaders\n
 Watch the parkin’ meters\n

 Ah get born, keep warm\n
 Short pants, romance, learn to dance\n
 Get dressed, get blessed\n
 Try to be a success\n
 Please her, please him, buy gifts\n
 Don’t steal, don’t lift\n
 Twenty years of schoolin’\n
 And they put you on the day shift\n
 Look out kid\n
 They keep it all hid\n
 Better jump down a manhole\n
 Light yourself a candle\n
 Don’t wear sandals\n
 Try to avoid the scandals\n
 Don’t wanna be a bum\n
 You better chew gum\n
 The pump don’t work\n
 ’Cause the vandals took the handles\n

She’s got everything she needs\n
 She’s an artist, she don’t look back\n
 She’s got everything she needs\n
 She’s an artist, she don’t look back\n
 She can take the dark out of the nighttime\n
 And paint the daytime black\n

 You will start out standing\n
 Proud to steal her anything she sees\n
 You will start out standing\n
 Proud to steal her anything she sees\n
 But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole\n
 Down upon your knees\n

 She never stumbles\n
 She’s got no place to fall\n
 She never stumbles\n
 She’s got no place to fall\n
 She’s nobody’s child\n
 The Law can’t touch her at all\n

 She wears an Egyptian ring\n
 That sparkles before she speaks\n
 She wears an Egyptian ring\n
 That sparkles before she speaks\n
 She’s a hypnotist collector\n
 You are a walking antique\n

 Bow down to her on Sunday\n
 Salute her when her birthday comes\n
 Bow down to her on Sunday\n
 Salute her when her birthday comes\n
 For Halloween give her a trumpet\n
 And for Christmas, buy her a drum\n

    I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 Well, I wake in the morning\n
 Fold my hands and pray for rain\n
 I got a head full of ideas\n
 That are drivin’ me insane\n
 It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor\n
 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n
 Well, he hands you a nickel\n

 He asks you with a grin\n
 If you’re havin’ a good time\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n
 Well, he puts his cigar\n
 Out in your face just for kicks\n
 His bedroom window\n
 It is made out of bricks\n
 The National Guard stands around his door\n
 Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n
 Well, she talks to all the servants\n
 About man and God and law\n
 Everybody says\n

 She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four\n
 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\n

 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n
 Well, I try my best\n
 To be just like I am\n
 But everybody wants you\n
 To be just like them\n
 They sing while you slave and I just get bored\n
 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\n

    My love she speaks like silence\n
 Without ideals or violence\n
 She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful\n
 Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire\n
 People carry roses\n
 Make promises by the hours\n
 My love she laughs like the flowers\n
 Valentines can’t buy her\n

 In the dime stores and bus stations\n
 People talk of situations\n
 Read books, repeat quotations\n
 Draw conclusions on the wall\n
 Some speak of the future\n
 My love she speaks softly\n
 She knows there’s no success like failure\n
 And that failure’s no success at all\n

 The cloak and dagger dangles\n
 Madams light the candles\n
 In ceremonies of the horsemen\n
 Even the pawn must hold a grudge\n
 Statues made of matchsticks\n
 Crumble into one another\n
 My love winks, she does not bother\n
 She knows too much to argue or to judge\n

 The bridge at midnight trembles\n
 The country doctor rambles\n
 Bankers’ nieces seek perfection\n
 Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring\n
 The wind howls like a hammer\n
 The night blows cold and rainy\n
 My love she’s like some raven\n
 At my window with a broken wing\n

    Ain’t it hard to stumble\n
 And land in some funny lagoon?\n
 Ain’t it hard to stumble\n
 And land in some muddy lagoon?\n
 Especially when it’s nine below zero\n
 And three o’clock in the afternoon.\n

 Ain’t gonna hang no picture\n
 Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame\n
 Ain’t gonna hang no picture\n
 Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame\n
 Well, I might look like Robert Ford\n
 But I feel just like a Jesse James\n

 Well, I wish I was on some\n
 Australian mountain range\n
 Oh, I wish I was on some\n
 Australian mountain range\n
 I got no reason to be there, but I\n
 Imagine it would be some kind of change\n

 I got my dark sunglasses\n
 I got for good luck my black tooth\n
 I got my dark sunglasses\n
 I’m carryin’ for good luck my black tooth\n
 Don’t ask me nothin’ about nothin’\n
 I just might tell you the truth\n

 I got a woman in Jackson\n

 I got a woman in Jackson\n
 I ain’t gonna say her name\n
 She’s a brown-skin woman, but I\n
 Love her just the same\n

    Well, I woke up in the morning\n
 There’s frogs inside my socks\n
 Your mama, she’s a-hidin’\n
 Inside the icebox\n
 Your daddy walks in wearin’\n
 A Napoleon Bonaparte mask\n
 Then you ask why I don’t live here\n
 Honey, do you have to ask?\n

 Well, I go to pet your monkey\n
 I get a face full of claws\n
 I ask who’s in the fireplace\n
 And you tell me Santa Claus\n
 The milkman comes in\n
 He’s wearing a derby hat\n
 Then you ask why I don’t live here\n
 Honey, how come you have to ask me that?\n

 Well, I asked for something to eat\n
 I’m hungry as a hog\n
 So I get brown rice, seaweed\n
 And a dirty hot dog\n
 I’ve got a hole\n
 Where my stomach disappeared\n
 Then you ask why I don’t live here\n
 Honey, I gotta think you’re really weird\n

 Your grandpa’s cane\n
 It turns into a sword\n
 Your grandma prays to pictures\n
 That are pasted on a board\n
 Everything inside my pockets\n
 Your uncle steals\n
 Then you ask why I don’t live here\n
 Honey, I can’t believe that you’re for real\n

 Well, there’s fistfights in the kitchen\n
 They’re enough to make me cry\n
 The mailman comes in\n
 Even he’s gotta take a side\n
 Even the butler\n
 He’s got something to prove\n
 Then you ask why I don’t live here\n
 Honey, how come you don’t move?\n

    I was riding on the Mayflower\n
 When I thought I spied some land\n
 I yelled for Captain Arab\n
 I have yuh understand\n
 Who came running to the deck\n
 Said, “Boys, forget the whale\n
 Look on over yonder\n
 Cut the engines\n
 Change the sail\n
 Haul on the bowline”\n
 We sang that melody\n
 Like all tough sailors do\n
 When they are far away at sea\n

 “I think I’ll call it America”\n
 I said as we hit land\n
 I took a deep breath\n
 I fell down, I could not stand\n
 Captain Arab he started\n
 Writing up some deeds\n
 He said, “Let’s set up a fort\n
 And start buying the place with beads”\n
 Just then this cop comes down the street\n
 Crazy as a loon\n
 He throw us all in jail\n
 For carryin’ harpoons\n

 Ah me I busted out\n
 Don’t even ask me how\n
 I went to get some help\n
 I walked by a Guernsey cow\n
 Who directed me down\n
 To the Bowery slums\n
 Where people carried signs around\n
 Saying, “Ban the bums”\n
 I jumped right into line\n
 Sayin’, “I hope that I’m not late”\n
 When I realized I hadn’t eaten\n
 For five days straight\n

 I went into a restaurant\n
 Lookin’ for the cook\n
 I told them I was the editor\n
 Of a famous etiquette book\n
 The waitress he was handsome\n
 He wore a powder blue cape\n
 I ordered some suzette, I said\n
 “Could you please make that crepe”\n
 Just then the whole kitchen exploded\n
 From boilin’ fat\n
 Food was flying everywhere\n
 And I left without my hat\n

 Now, I didn’t mean to be nosy\n
 But I went into a bank\n
 To get some bail for Arab\n
 And all the boys back in the tank\n
 They asked me for some collateral\n
 And I pulled down my pants\n
 They threw me in the alley\n
 When up comes this girl from France\n
 Who invited me to her house\n
 I went, but she had a friend\n
 Who knocked me out\n
 And robbed my boots\n
 And I was on the street again\n

 Well, I rapped upon a house\n
 With the U.S. flag upon display\n
 I said, “Could you help me out\n
 I got some friends down the way”\n
 The man says, “Get out of here\n
 I’ll tear you limb from limb”\n
 I said, “You know they refused Jesus, too”\n
 He said, “You’re not Him\n
 Get out of here before I break your bones\n
 I ain’t your pop”\n
 I decided to have him arrested\n
 And I went looking for a cop\n

 I ran right outside\n
 And I hopped inside a cab\n
 I went out the other door\n
 This Englishman said, “Fab”\n
 As he saw me leap a hot dog stand\n
 And a chariot that stood\n
 Parked across from a building\n
 Advertising brotherhood\n
 I ran right through the front door\n
 Like a hobo sailor does\n
 But it was just a funeral parlor\n
 And the man asked me who I was\n

 I repeated that my friends\n
 Were all in jail, with a sigh\n
 He gave me his card\n
 He said, “Call me if they die”\n
 I shook his hand and said goodbye\n
 Ran out to the street\n
 When a bowling ball came down the road\n
 And knocked me off my feet\n
 A pay phone was ringing\n
 It just about blew my mind\n
 When I picked it up and said hello\
 This foot came through the line\n
 Well, by this time I was fed up\n
 At tryin’ to make a stab\n
 At bringin’ back any help\n
 For my friends and Captain Arab\n
 I decided to flip a coin\n
 Like either heads or tails\n
 Would let me know if I should go\n
 Back to ship or back to jail\n
 So I hocked my sailor suit\n
 And I got a coin to flip\n
 It came up tails\n
 It rhymed with sails\n
 So I made it back to the ship\n


 Well, I got back and took\n
 The parkin’ ticket off the mast\n
 I was ripping it to shreds\n
 When this coastguard boat went past\n
 They asked me my name\n
 And I said, “Captain Kidd”\n
 They believed me but\n
 They wanted to know\n
 What exactly that I did\n
 I said for the Pope of Eruke\n
 I was employed\n
 They let me go right away\n
 They were very paranoid\n

 Well, the last I heard of Arab\n
    He was stuck on a whale\n
 That was married to the deputy\n
 Sheriff of the jail\n
 But the funniest thing was\n
 When I was leavin’ the bay\n
 I saw three ships a-sailin’\n
 They were all heading my way\n
 I asked the captain what his name was\n
 And how come he didn’t drive a truck\n
 He said his name was Columbus\n
 I just said, “Good luck”\n

    Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to\n
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n

 Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand\n
 Vanished from my hand\n
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping\n
 My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet\n
 I have no one to meet\n
 And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming\n

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to\n
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n

 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship\n
 My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip\n
 My toes too numb to step\n
 Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’\n
 I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade\n
 Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way\n
 I promise to go under it\n

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to\n
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n

 Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun\n
 It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the run\n
 And but for the sky there are no fences facin’\n
 And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme\n
 To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind\n
 I wouldn’t pay it any mind\n
 It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing\n

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to\n
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n

 Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind\n
 Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves\n
 The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach\n
 Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow\n
 Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free\n
 Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands\n
 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves\n
 Let me forget about today until tomorrow\n

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to\n
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n

    Of war and peace the truth just twists\n
 Its curfew gull just glides\n
 Upon four-legged forest clouds\n
 The cowboy angel rides\n
 With his candle lit into the sun\n
 Though its glow is waxed in black\n
 All except when ’neath the trees of Eden\n

 The lamppost stands with folded arms\n
 Its iron claws attached\n
 To curbs ’neath holes where babies wail\n
 Though it shadows metal badge\n
 All and all can only fall\n
 With a crashing but meaningless blow\n
 No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden\n
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand\n
 And then complains\n
 Unto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deaf\n
 But still remains\n
 Upon the beach where hound dogs bay\n
 At ships with tattooed sails\n
 Heading for the Gates of Eden\n

 With a time-rusted compass blade\n
 Aladdin and his lamp\n
 Sits with Utopian hermit monks\n
 Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf\n
 And on their promises of paradise\n
 You will not hear a laugh\n
 All except inside the Gates of Eden\n

 Relationships of ownership\n
 They whisper in the wings\n
 To those condemned to act accordingly\n
 And wait for succeeding kings\n
 And I try to harmonize with songs\n
 The lonesome sparrow sings\n
 There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden\n

 The motorcycle black madonna\n
 Two-wheeled gypsy queen\n
 And her silver-studded phantom cause\n
 The gray flannel dwarf to scream\n
 As he weeps to wicked birds of prey\n
 Who pick up on his bread crumb sins\n
 And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden\n

 The kingdoms of Experience\n
 In the precious wind they rot\n
 While paupers change possessions\n
 Each one wishing for what the other has got\n
 And the princess and the prince\n
 Discuss what’s real and what is not\n
 It doesn’t matter inside the Gates of Eden\n

 The foreign sun, it squints upon\n
 A bed that is never mine\n
 As friends and other strangers\n
 From their fates try to resign\n
 Leaving men wholly, totally free\n
 To do anything they wish to do but die\n
 And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden\n

 At dawn my lover comes to me\n
 And tells me of her dreams\n
 With no attempts to shovel the glimpse\n
 Into the ditch of what each one means\n
 At times I think there are no words\n
 But these to tell what’s true\n
 And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden\n

<string name="itsalrightmalyrics">
    Darkness at the break of noon\n
 Shadows even the silver spoon\n
 The handmade blade, the child’s balloon\n
 Eclipses both the sun and moon\n
 To understand you know too soon\n
 There is no sense in trying\n

 Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn\n
 Suicide remarks are torn\n
 From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn\n
 Plays wasted words, proves to warn\n
 That he not busy being born is busy dying\n
 Temptation’s page flies out the door\n
 You follow, find yourself at war\n
 Watch waterfalls of pity roar\n
 You feel to moan but unlike before\n
 You discover that you’d just be one more\n
 Person crying\n

 So don’t fear if you hear\n
 A foreign sound to your ear\n
 It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing\n

 As some warn victory, some downfall\n
 Private reasons great or small\n
 Can be seen in the eyes of those that call\n
 To make all that should be killed to crawl\n
 While others say don’t hate nothing at all\n
 Except hatred\n

 Disillusioned words like bullets bark\n
 As human gods aim for their mark\n
 Make everything from toy guns that spark\n
 To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark\n
 It’s easy to see without looking too far\n
 That not much is really sacred\n

 While preachers preach of evil fates\n
 Teachers teach that knowledge waits\n
 Can lead to hundred-dollar plates\n
 Goodness hides behind its gates\n
 But even the president of the United States\n
 Sometimes must have to stand naked\n

 An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged\n
 It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge\n
 And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it\n

 Advertising signs they con\n
 You into thinking you’re the one\n
 That can do what’s never been done\n
 That can win what’s never been won\n
 Meantime life outside goes on\n
 All around you\n

 You lose yourself, you reappear\n
 You suddenly find you got nothing to fear\n
 Alone you stand with nobody near\n
 When a trembling distant voice, unclear\n
 Startles your sleeping ears to hear\n
 That somebody thinks they really found you\n

 A question in your nerves is lit\n
 Yet you know there is no answer fit\n
 To satisfy, insure you not to quit\n
 To keep it in your mind and not forget\n
 That it is not he or she or them or it\n
 That you belong to\n

 Although the masters make the rules\n
 For the wise men and the fools\n
 I got nothing, Ma, to live up to\n

 For them that must obey authority\n
 That they do not respect in any degreen\n
 Who despise their jobs, their destinies\n
 Speak jealously of them that are free\n
 Cultivate their flowers to be\n
 Nothing more than something they invest in\n

 While some on principles baptized\n
 To strict party platform ties\n
 Social clubs in drag disguise\n
 Outsiders they can freely criticize\n
 Tell nothing except who to idolize\n
 And then say God bless him\n

 While one who sings with his tongue on fire\n
 Gargles in the rat race choir\n
 Bent out of shape from society’s pliers\n
 Cares not to come up any higher\n
 But rather get you down in the hole\n
 That he’s in\n

 But I mean no harm nor put fault\n
 On anyone that lives in a vault\n
 But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him\n

 Old lady judges watch people in pairs\n
 Limited in sex, they dare\n
 To push fake morals, insult and stare\n
 While money doesn’t talk, it swears\n
 Obscenity, who really cares\n
 Propaganda, all is phony\n

 While them that defend what they cannot see\n
 With a killer’s pride, security\n
 It blows the minds most bitterly\n
 For them that think death’s honesty\n
 Won’t fall upon them naturally\n
 Life sometimes must get lonely\n

 My eyes collide head-on with stuffed\n
 Graveyards, false gods, I scuff\n
 At pettiness which plays so rough\n
 Walk upside-down inside handcuffs\n
 Kick my legs to crash it off\n
 Say okay, I have had enough\n
 what else can you show me?\n

 And if my thought-dreams could be seen\n
 They’d probably put my head in a guillotine\n
 But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only\n

You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last\n
 But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast\n
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun\n
 Crying like a fire in the sun\n
 Look out the saints are comin’ through\n
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue\n

 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense\n
 Take what you have gathered from coincidence\n
 The empty-handed painter from your streets\n
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets\n
 This sky, too, is folding under you\n
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue\n

 All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home\n
 All your reindeer armies, are all going home\n
 The lover who just walked out your door\n
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor\n
 The carpet, too, is moving under you\n
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue\n

 Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you\n
 Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you\n
 The vagabond who’s rapping at your door\n
 Is standing in the clothes that you once wore\n
 Strike another match, go start anew\n
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue\n
