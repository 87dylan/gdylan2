    If not for you\n
    Babe, I couldn’t find the door\n
    Couldn’t even see the floor\n
    I’d be sad and blue\n
    If not for you\n
    If not for you\n
    Babe, I’d lay awake all night\n
    Wait for the mornin’ light\n
    To shine in through\n
    But it would not be new\n
    If not for you\n
    If not for you\n
    My sky would fall\n
    Rain would gather too\n
    Without your love I’d be nowhere at all\n
    I’d be lost if not for you\n
    And you know it’s true\n
    If not for you\n
    My sky would fall\n
    Rain would gather too\n
    Without your love I’d be nowhere at all\n
    Oh! what would I do\n
    If not for you\n
    If not for you\n
    Winter would have no spring\n
    Couldn’t hear the robin sing\n
    I just wouldn’t have a clue\n
    Anyway it wouldn’t ring true\n
    If not for you\n

    <string name="dayofthelocustlyrics">
        Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration\n
 The birdies were flying from tree to tree\n
 There was little to say, there was no conversation\n
 As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree\n
 And the locusts sang off in the distance\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody\n
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me\n
 I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking\n
 Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb\n
 I was ready to leave, I was already walkin’\n
 But the next time I looked there was light in the room\n
 And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill\n
 Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody\n
 Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me\n
 Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin’\n
 The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees\n
 The man standin’ next to me, his head was exploding\n
 Well, I was prayin’ the pieces wouldn’t fall on me\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody\n
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance\n
 And the locusts sang and they were singing for me\n
 I put down my robe, picked up my diploma\n
 Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive\n
 Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota\n
 Sure was glad to get out of there alive\n
 And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody\n
 And the locusts sang with a high whinin’ trill\n
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me\n
 Singing for me, well, singing for me\n

<string name="timepassesslowlylyrics">
    Time passes slowly up here in the mountains\n
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains\n
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream\n
 Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream\n

 Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin’\n
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin’\n
 Stared out the window to the stars high above\n
 Time passes slowly when you’re searchin’ for love\n

 Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town\n
 Ain’t no reason to go to the fair\n
 Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down\n
 Ain’t no reason to go anywhere\n

 Time passes slowly up here in the daylight\n
 We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right\n
 Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day\n
 Time passes slowly and fades away\n

<string name="wenttoseethegypsylyrics">

    Went to see the gypsy\n
 Stayin’ in a big hotel\n
 He smiled when he saw me coming\n
 And he said, “Well, well, well”\n
 His room was dark and crowded\n
 Lights were low and dim\n
 “How are you?” he said to me\n
 I said it back to him\n
 I went down to the lobby\n
 To make a small call out\n
 A pretty dancing girl was there\n
 And she began to shout\n
 “Go on back to see the gypsy\n
 He can move you from the rear\n
 Drive you from your fear\n
 Bring you through the mirror\n
 He did it in Las Vegas\n
 And he can do it here”\n
 Outside the lights were shining\n
 On the river of tears\n
 I watched them from the distance\n
 With music in my ears\n
 I went back to see the gypsy\n
 It was nearly early dawn\n
 The gypsy’s door was open wide\n
 But the gypsy was gone\n
 And that pretty dancing girl\n
 She could not be found\n
 So I watched that sun come rising\n
 From that little Minnesota town\n

        Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darlin’\n
 Winterlude by the road tonight\n
 Tonight there will be no quarrelin’\n
 Ev’rything is gonna be all right\n
 Oh, I see by the angel beside me\n
 That love has a reason to shine\n
 You’re the one I adore, come over here and give me more\n
 Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re fine\n
 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple\n
 Winterlude by the corn in the field\n
 Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel\n
 Then come back and cook up a meal\n
 Well, come out when the skating rink glistens\n
 By the sun, near the old crossroads sign\n
 The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold\n
 Winterlude, don’t be rude, please be mine\n
 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy\n
 Winterlude by the telephone wire\n
 Winterlude, it’s makin’ me lazy\n
 Come on, sit by the logs in the fire\n
 The moonlight reflects from the window\n
 Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand\n
 Come out tonight, ev’rything will be tight\n
 Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grand\n

        If dogs run free, then why not we\n
 Across the swooping plain?\n
 My ears hear a symphony\n
 Of two mules, trains and rain\n
 The best is always yet to come\n
 That’s what they explain to me\n
 Just do your thing, you’ll be king\n
 If dogs run free\n
 If dogs run free, why not me\n
 Across the swamp of time?\n
 My mind weaves a symphony\n
 And tapestry of rhyme\n
 Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee\n
 So it may flow and be\n
 To each his own, it’s all unknown\n
 If dogs run free\n
 If dogs run free, then what must be\n
 Must be, and that is all\n
 True love can make a blade of grass\n
 Stand up straight and tall\n
 In harmony with the cosmic sea\n
 True love needs no company\n
 It can cure the soul, it can make it whole\n
 If dogs run free\n

    <string name="newmorninglyrics">
        Can’t you hear that rooster crowin’?\n
 Rabbit runnin’ down across the road\n
 Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through\n
 So happy just to see you smile\n
 Underneath the sky of blue\n
 On this new morning, new morning\n
 On this new morning with you\n
 Can’t you hear that motor turnin’?\n
 Automobile comin’ into style\n
 Comin’ down the road for a country mile or two\n
 So happy just to see you smile\n
 Underneath the sky of blue\n
 On this new morning, new morning\n
 On this new morning with you\n
 The night passed away so quickly\n
 It always does when you’re with me\n
 Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’?\n
 Groundhog runnin’ by the country stream\n
 This must be the day that all of my dreams come true\n
 So happy just to be alive\n
 Underneath the sky of blue\n
 On this new morning, new morning\n
 On this new morning with you\n
 So happy just to be alive\n
 Underneath the sky of blue\n
 On this new morning, new morning\n
 On this new morning with you\n
 New morning . . .\n

 I’m lookin’ good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun\n
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you\n

 We’ll fly over the ocean just like you suspect\n
 One more weekend, one more weekend with you\n

 Things will be okay\n

        The man in me will do nearly any task\n
 And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask\n
 Take a woman like you\n
 To get through to the man in me\n
 Storm clouds are raging all around my door\n
 I think to myself I might not take it anymore\n
 Take a woman like your kind\n
 To find the man in me\n
 But, oh, what a wonderful feeling\n
 Just to know that you are near\n
 Sets my heart a-reeling\n
 From my toes up to my ears\n
 The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen\n
 But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine\n
 Took a woman like you\n
 To get through to the man in me\n

    <string name="threeangelslyrics">
        Three angels up above the street\n
 Each one playing a horn\n
 Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out\n
 They’ve been there since Christmas morn\n
 The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash\n
 Then a lady in a bright orange dress\n
 One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels\n
 The Tenth Avenue bus going west\n
 The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around\n
 A man with a badge skips by\n
 Three fellas crawlin’ on their way back to work\n
 Nobody stops to ask why\n
 The bakery truck stops outside of that fence\n
 Where the angels stand high on their poles\n
 The driver peeks out, trying to find one face\n
 In this concrete world full of souls\n
 The angels play on their horns all day\n
 The whole earth in progression seems to pass by\n
 But does anyone hear the music they play\n
 Does anyone even try?\n

        Father of night, Father of day\n
 Father, who taketh the darkness away\n
 Father, who teacheth the bird to fly\n
 Builder of rainbows up in the sky\n
 Father of loneliness and pain\n
 Father of love and Father of rain\n
 Father of day, Father of night\n
 Father of black, Father of white\n
 Father, who build the mountain so high\n
 Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky\n
 Father of time, Father of dreams\n
 Father, who turneth the rivers and streams\n
 Father of grain, Father of wheat\n
 Father of cold and Father of heat\n
 Father of air and Father of trees\n
 Who dwells in our hearts and our memories\n
 Father of minutes, Father of days\n
 Father of whom we most solemnly praise\n
