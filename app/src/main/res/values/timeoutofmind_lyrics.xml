<string name="lovesicklyrics">
    I’m walking through streets that are dead\n
 Walking, walking with you in my head\n
 My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired\n
 And the clouds are weeping\n

 Did I hear someone tell a lie?\n
 Did I hear someone’s distant cry?\n
 You thrilled me to my heart, then you ripped it all apart \n
 You went through my pockets when I was sleeping\n

 I’m sick of love…but I’m in the thick of it\n
 This kind of love…I’m so sick of it\n
 I see lovers in the meadow\n
 I see silhouettes in the window\n
 I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on\n
 To a shadow\n

 I’m sick of love…I hear the clock tick\n
 This kind of love…I’m love sick\n

 Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder\n
 Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under\n
 Could you ever be true? I think of you\n
 And I wonder\n

 I’m sick of love…I wish I’d never met you\n
 I’m sick of love…I’m trying to forget you\n

 Just don’t know what to do\n
 I’d give anything to be with you\n

Gon’ walk down that dirt road,\n
 ’til someone lets me ride\n
 Gon’ walk down that dirt road,\n
 ’til someone lets me ride\n
 If I can’t find my baby, \n
 I’m gonna run away and hide\n
 I been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back\n
 Pacing ’round the room hoping maybe she’d come back\n
 Well, I been praying for salvation laying\n
    ’round in a one-room country shack\n

 Gon’ walk down that dirt road \n
 until my eyes begin to bleed\n
 Gon’ walk down that dirt road\n
 until my eyes begin to bleed\n
 ’Til there’s nothing left to see, \n
    ’til the chains have been shattered \n
 and I’ve been freed\n

 I been lookin’ at my shadow,\n
 I been watching the colors up above\n
 Lookin’ at my shadow, watching the colors up above\n
 Rolling through the rain and hail,\n
    looking for the sunny side of love\n

 Gon’ walk on down that dirt road \n
 ’til I’m right beside the sun\n
 Gon’ walk on down until I’m right beside the sun\n
 I’m gonna have to put up a barrier \n
 to keep myself away from everyone\n

I’m walking through the summer nights\n
 Jukebox playing low\n
 Yesterday everything was going too fast\n
 Today, it’s moving too slow\n
 I got no place left to turn\n
 I got nothing left to burn\n
 Don’t know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you\n
 It probably wouldn’t matter to you anyhow\n
 You left me standing in the doorway crying\n
 I got nothing to go back to now\n
 The light in this place is so bad\n
 Making me sick in the head\n
 All the laughter is just making me sad\n
 The stars have turned cherry red\n
 I’m strumming on my gay guitar\n
 Smoking a cheap cigar\n
 The ghost of our old love has not gone away\n
 Don’t look like it will anytime soon\n
 You left me standing in the doorway crying\n
 Under the midnight moon\n
 Maybe they’ll get me and maybe they won’t\n
 But not tonight and it won’t be here\n
 There are things I could say but I don’t\n
 I know the mercy of God must be near\n
 I’ve been riding the midnight train\n
 Got ice water in my veins\n
 I would be crazy if I took you back\n
 It would go up against every rule\n
 You left me standing in the doorway crying\n
 Suffering like a fool\n
 When the last rays of daylight go down\n
 Buddy, you’ll roll no more\n
 I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard\n
 I wonder who they’re ringing for\n
 I know I can’t win\n
 But my heart just won’t give in\n
 Last night I danced with a stranger\n
 But she just reminded me you were the one\n
 You left me standing in the doorway crying\n
 In the dark land of the sun\n
 I’ll eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry\n
 And live my life on the square\n
 And even if the flesh falls off of my face\n
 I know someone will be there to care\n
 It always means so much\n
 Even the softest touch\n
 I see nothing to be gained by any explanation\n
 There are no words that need to be said\n
 You left me standing in the doorway crying\n
 Blues wrapped around my head\n

You took a part of me that I really miss\n
 I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this\n
 You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too\n
 I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 You took the silver, you took the gold\n
 You left me standing out in the cold\n
 People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew\n
 Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep\n
 Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep\n
 Did so many things I never did intend to do\n
 Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low\n
 I need every bit of it for the places that I go\n
 Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to\n
 Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink\n
 Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think\n
 Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who\n
 Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 The last thing you said before you hit the street\n
 “Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”\n
 I said, “That’s all right, you do what you gotta do”\n
 Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer, I’m still a million miles from you\n
 Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real\n
 Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel\n
 And I’ll rock you too\n
 I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n
 Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard\n
 I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word\n
 I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two\n
 Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\n

The air is getting hotter\n
 There’s a rumbling in the skies\n
 I’ve been wading through the high muddy water\n
 With the heat rising in my eyes\n
 Every day your memory grows dimmer\n
 It doesn’t haunt me like it did before\n
 I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere\n
 Trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n

 When I was in Missouri\n
 They would not let me be\n
 I had to leave there in a hurry\n
 I only saw what they let me see\n
 You broke a heart that loved you\n
 Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore\n
 I’ve been walking that lonesome valley\n
 Trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n

 People on the platforms\n
 Waiting for the trains\n
 I can hear their hearts a-beatin’\n
 Like pendulums swinging on chains\n
 I tried to give you everything\n
 That your heart was longing for\n
 I’m just going down the road feeling bad\n
 Trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n
 I’m going down the river\n
 Down to New Orleans\n
 They tell me everything is gonna be all right\n
 But I don’t know what “all right” even means\n
 I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane\n
 Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore\n
 I been all around the world, boys\n
 Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n
 Gonna sleep down in the parlor\n
 And relive my dreams\n
 I’ll close my eyes and I wonder\n
 If everything is as hollow as it seems\n
 When you think that you’ve lost everything\n
 You find out you can always lose a little more\n
 I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down\n
 Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n

Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense\n
 I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence\n
 I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much\n
 Nothing can heal me now, but your touch\n
 I don’t know what I’m gonna do\n
 I was all right ’til I fell in love with you\n
 Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky\n
 I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by\n
 Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way\n
 But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray\n
 Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do\n
 I was all right ’til I fell in love with you\n

 Boys in the street beginning to play\n
 Girls like birds flying away\n
 When I’m gone you will remember my name\n
 I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame\n
 I don’t know what I’m gonna do\n
 I was all right ’til I fell in love with you\n
 Junk is piling up, taking up space\n
 My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face\n
 Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor\n
 I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more\n
 I don’t know what I’m gonna do\n
 I was all right ’til I fell in love with you\n

 Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain\n
 My attempts to please you were all in vain\n
 Tomorrow night before the sun goes down\n
 If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound\n
 I just don’t know what I’m gonna do\n
 I was all right ’til I fell in love with you\n

    Shadows are falling and I’ve been here all day\n
 It’s too hot to sleep, time is running away\n
 Feel like my soul has turned into steel\n
 I’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t heal\n
 There’s not even room enough to be anywhere\n
 It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n
 Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain\n
 Behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain\n
 She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind\n
 She put down in writing what was in her mind\n
 I just don’t see why I should even care\n
 It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n
 Well, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paree\n
 I’ve followed the river and I got to the sea\n
 I’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of lies\n
 I ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyes\n
 Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear\n
 It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n

 I was born here and I’ll die here against my will\n
 I know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still\n
 Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb\n
 I can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from\n
 Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer\n
 It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n

I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around\n
 Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown\n
 I went to church on Sunday and she passed by\n
 My love for her is taking such a long time to die\n

 I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist\n
 It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist\n
 I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n

 The walls of pride are high and wide\n
 Can’t see over to the other side\n
 It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay\n
 It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away\n

 One look at you and I’m out of control\n
 Like the universe has swallowed me whole\n
 I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n

 There’s too many people, too many to recall\n
 I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all\n
 Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud\n
 Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood\n

 I found my world, found my world in you\n
 But your love just hasn’t proved true\n
 I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n
 Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n

 Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds\n
 Reality has always had too many heads\n
 Some things last longer than you think they will\n
 There are some kind of things you can never kill\n

 It’s you and you only I been thinking about\n
 But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out\n
 I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n

 Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank\n
 The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank\n
 I tried to love and protect you because I cared\n
 I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared\n

 Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee\n
 You have no idea what you do to me\n
 I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n
 Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n

When the rain is blowing in your face\n
 And the whole world is on your case\n
 I could offer you a warm embrace\n
 To make you feel my love\n
 When the evening shadows and the stars appear\n
 And there is no one there to dry your tears\n
 I could hold you for a million years\n
 To make you feel my love\n

 I know you haven’t made your mind up yet\n
 But I would never do you wrong\n
 I’ve known it from the moment that we met\n
 No doubt in my mind where you belong\n

 I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue\n
 I’d go crawling down the avenue\n
 There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do\n
 To make you feel my love\n

 The storms are raging on the rollin’ sea\n
 And on the highway of regret\n
 Put your hand in mine and come with me \n
 I’ll see that you don’t get wet\n

 I could make you happy, make your dreams come true\n
 Nothing that I wouldn’t do\n
 Go to the ends of the earth for you\n
 To make you feel my love\n

I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind\n
 It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line\n
 Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around\n
 Some on their way up, some on their way down\n
 The air burns and I’m trying to think straight\n
 And I don’t know how much longer I can wait\n
 I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew\n
 You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you\n
 Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow\n
 I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so\n
 I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate\n
 But I don’t know how much longer I can wait\n
 Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow\n
 Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go\n
 If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do\n
 I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true\n
 That’s how it is when things disintegrate\n
 And I don’t know how much longer I can wait\n
 I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather\n
 I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together\n
 It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun\n
 Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one\n
 While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind\n
 I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line\n
 I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate\n
 But I don’t know how much longer I can wait\n

Well my heart’s in the Highlands, gentle and fair\n
 Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air\n
 Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow\n
 Well my heart’s in the Highland\n
 I’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go\n
 Windows were shakin’ all night in my dreams\n
 Everything was exactly the way that it seems\n
 Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page\n
 Same ol’ rat race\n
 Life in the same ol’ cage\n

 I don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take\n
 Wouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake\n
 Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery\n
 I wish someone would come\n
 And push back the clock for me\n
 Well my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam\n
 That’s where I’ll be when I get called home\n
 The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme\n
 Well my heart’s in the Highlands\n
 I can only get there one step at a time\n
 I’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound\n
 Someone’s always yelling turn it down\n
 Feel like I’m drifting\n
 Drifting from scene to scene\n
 I’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?\n
 Insanity is smashing up against my soul\n
 You can say I was on anything but a roll\n
 If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top\n
 What would I do with it anyway\n
 Maybe take it to the pawn shop\n
 My heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn\n
 By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan\n
 Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low\n
 Well my heart’s in the Highlands\n
 Only place left to go\n
 I’m in Boston town, in some restaurant\n
 I got no idea what I want\n
 Well, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure\n
 Waitress comes over\n
 Nobody in the place but me and her\n
 It must be a holiday, there’s nobody around\n
 She studies me closely as I sit down\n
 She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs\n
 She says, “What’ll it be?”\n
 I say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”\n
 She looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some\n
 But we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”\n
 Then she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”\n
 I say, “I would if I could, but\n
 I don’t do sketches from memory”\n
 “Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”\n
 I say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”\n
 She gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”\n
 I say, “Yes I could, but\n
 I don’t know where my pencil is at!”\n
 She pulls one out from behind her ear\n
 She says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”\n
 I make a few lines and I show it for her to see\n
 Well she takes the napkin and throws it back\n
 And says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”\n
 I said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”\n
 She says, “You must be jokin’.” I say, “I wish I was!”\n
 Then she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”\n
 Least that’s what I think I hear her say\n
 “Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”\n
 “Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”\n
 I said, “You’re way wrong”\n
 She says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”\n
 She goes away for a minute\n
 And I slide up out of my chair\n
 I step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere\n
 Well my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds\n
 Way up in the border country, far from the towns\n
 With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow\n
 My heart’s in the Highlands\n
 Can’t see any other way to go\n
 Every day is the same thing out the door\n
 Feel further away then ever before\n
 Some things in life, it gets too late to learn\n
 Well, I’m lost somewhere\n
 I must have made a few bad turns\n

 I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes\n
 They’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes\n
 All the young men with their young women looking so good\n
 Well, I’d trade places with any of them\n
 In a minute, if I could\n
 I’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog\n
 Talking to myself in a monologue\n
 I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat\n
 Somebody just asked me\n
 If I registered to vote\n
 The sun is beginning to shine on me\n
 But it’s not like the sun that used to be\n
 The party’s over and there’s less and less to say\n
 I got new eyes\n
 Everything looks far away\n
 Well, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day\n
 Over the hills and far away\n
 There’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow\n
 But I’m already there in my mind\n
 And that’s good enough for now\n
