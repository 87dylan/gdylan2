        Well, if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair\n
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline\n
 Remember me to one who lives there\n
 She once was a true love of mine\n

 Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm\n
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends\n
 Please see if she’s wearing a coat so warm\n
 To keep her from the howlin’ winds\n

 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,\n
 If it rolls and flows all down her breast.\n
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,\n
 That’s the way I remember her best.\n

 I’m a-wonderin’ if she remembers me at all\n
 Many times I’ve often prayed\n
 In the darkness of my night\n
 In the brightness of my day\n

 So if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair\n
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline\n
 Remember me to one who lives there\n
 She once was a true love of mine\n

To be alone with you\n
 Just you and me\n
 Now won’t you tell me true\n
 Ain’t that the way it oughta be?\n
 To hold each other tight\n
 The whole night through\n
 Ev’rything is always right\n
 When I’m alone with you\n

 To be alone with you\n
 At the close of the day\n
 With only you in view\n
 While evening slips away\n
 It only goes to show\n
 That while life’s pleasures be few\n
 The only one I know\n
 Is when I’m alone with you\n

 They say that nighttime is the right time\n
 To be with the one you love\n
 Too many thoughts get in the way in the day\n
 But you’re always what I’m thinkin’ of\n
 I wish the night were here\n
 Bringin’ me all of your charms\n
 When only you are near\n
 To hold me in your arms\n

 I’ll always thank the Lord\n
 When my working day’s through\n
 I get my sweet reward\n
 To be alone with you\n

I once held her in my arms\n
 She said she would always stay\n
 But I was cruel\n
 I treated her like a fool\n
 I threw it all away\n

 Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand\n
 And rivers that ran through ev’ry day\n
 I must have been mad\n
 I never knew what I had\n
 Until I threw it all away\n

 Love is all there is, it makes the world go ’round\n
 Love and only love, it can’t be denied\n
 No matter what you think about it\n
 You just won’t be able to do without it\n
 Take a tip from one who’s tried\n

 So if you find someone that gives you all of her love\n
 Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray\n
 For one thing that’s certain\n
 You will surely be a-hurtin’\n
 If you throw it all away\n

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away\n
 By golly, what more can I say\n
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day\n

 Peggy night makes my future look so bright\n
 Man, that girl is out of sight\n
 Love to spend the day with Peggy night\n

 Well, you know that even before I learned her name\n
 You know I loved her just the same\n
 An’ I tell ’em all, wherever I may go\n
 Just so they’ll know, that she’s my little lady\n
 And I love her so\n

 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away\n
 Turned my skies to blue from gray\n
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day\n

 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away\n
 By golly, what more can I say\n
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day\n
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day\n

       Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Whatever colors you have in your mind\n
 I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine\n

 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile\n
 Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile\n
 His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean\n
 And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen\n

 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile\n
 Why wait any longer for the world to begin\n
 You can have your cake and eat it too\n
 Why wait any longer for the one you love\n
 When he’s standing in front of you\n

 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead\n
 I long to see you in the morning light\n
 I long to reach for you in the night\n
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead\n

One more night, the stars are in sight\n
 But tonight I’m as lonesome as can be\n
 Oh, the moon is shinin’ bright\n
 Lighting ev’rything in sight\n
 But tonight no light will shine on me\n

 Oh, it’s shameful and it’s sad I lost the only pal I had\n
 I just could not be what she wanted me to be\n
 I will turn my head up high\n
 To that dark and rolling sky\n
 For tonight no light will shine on me\n
 I was so mistaken when I thought that she’d be true\n
 I had no idea what a woman in love would do!\n

 One more night, I will wait for the light\n
 While the wind blows high above the tree\n
 Oh, I miss my darling so\n
 I didn’t mean to see her go\n
 But tonight no light will shine on me\n

 One more night, the moon is shinin’ bright\n
 And the wind blows high above the tree\n
 Oh, I miss that woman so\n
 I didn’t mean to see her go\n
 But tonight no light will shine on me\n

I have heard rumors all over town\n
 They say that you’re planning to put me down\n
 All I would like you to do\n
 Is tell me that it isn’t true\n

 They say that you’ve been seen with some other man\n
 That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holding his hand\n
 Darlin’, I’m a-countin’ on you\n
 Tell me that it isn’t true\n

 To know that some other man is holdin’ you tight\n
 It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right\n

 All of those awful things that I have heard\n
 I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word\n
 So darlin’, you better come through\n
 Tell me that it isn’t true\n

 All of those awful things that I have heard\n
 I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word\n
 So darlin’, I’m countin’ on you\n
 Tell me that it isn’t true\n

Just like old Saxophone Joe\n
 When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe\n
 Oh me, oh my\n
 Love that country pie\n

 Listen to the fiddler play\n
 When he’s playin’ ’til the break of day\n
 Oh me, oh my\n
 Love that country pie\n

 Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime\n
 What do I care?\n
 Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum\n
 Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there\n

 Saddle me up my big white goose\n
 Tie me on ’er and turn her loose\n
 Oh me, oh my\n
 Love that country pie\n

 I don’t need much and that ain’t no lie\n
 Ain’t runnin’ any race\n
 Give to me my country pie\n
 I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face\n

 Shake me up that old peach tree\n
 Little Jack Horner’s got nothin’ on me\n
 Oh me, oh my\n
 Love that country pie\n

Throw my ticket out the window\n
 Throw my suitcase out there, too\n
 Throw my troubles out the door\n
 I don’t need them anymore\n
 ’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you\n

 I should have left this town this morning\n
 But it was more than I could do\n
 Oh, your love comes on so strong\n
 And I’ve waited all day long\n
 For tonight when I’ll be staying here with you\n

 Is it really any wonder\n
 The love that a stranger might receive\n
 You cast your spell and I went under\n
 I find it so difficult to leave\n

 I can hear that whistle blowin’\n
 I see that stationmaster, too\n
 If there’s a poor boy on the street\n
 Then let him have my seat\n
 ’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you\n
 Throw my ticket out the window\n
 Throw my suitcase out there, too\n
 Throw my troubles out the door\n
 I don’t need them anymore\n
 ’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you\n
