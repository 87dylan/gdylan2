        John Wesley Harding\n
 Was a friend to the poor\n
 He trav’led with a gun in ev’ry hand\n
 All along this countryside\n
 He opened many a door\n
 But he was never known\n
 To hurt an honest man\n
 ’Twas down in Chaynee County\n
 A time they talk about\n
 With his lady by his side\n
 He took a stand\n
 And soon the situation there\n
 Was all but straightened out\n
 For he was always known\n
 To lend a helping hand\n
 All across the telegraph\n
 His name it did resound\n
 But no charge held against him\n
 Could they prove\n
 And there was no man around\n
 Who could track or chain him down\n
 He was never known\n
 To make a foolish move\n

        As I went out one morning\n
 To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s\n
 I spied the fairest damsel\n
 That ever did walk in chains\n
 I offer’d her my hand\n
 She took me by the arm\n
 I knew that very instant\n
 She meant to do me harm\n
 “Depart from me this moment”\n
 I told her with my voice\n
 Said she, “But I don’t wish to”\n
 Said I, “But you have no choice”\n
 “I beg you, sir,” she pleaded\n
 From the corners of her mouth\n
 “I will secretly accept you\n
 And together we’ll fly south”\n
 Just then Tom Paine, himself\n
 Came running from across the field\n
 Shouting at this lovely girl\n
 And commanding her to yield\n
 And as she was letting go her grip\n
 Up Tom Paine did run,\n
 “I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me\n
 “I’m sorry for what she’s done”\n

        I dreamed I saw St. Augustine\n
 Alive as you or me\n
 Tearing through these quarters\n
 In the utmost misery\n
 With a blanket underneath his arm\n
 And a coat of solid gold\n
 Searching for the very souls\n
 Whom already have been sold\n
 “Arise, arise,” he cried so loud\n
 In a voice without restraint\n
 “Come out, ye gifted kings and queens\n
 And hear my sad complaint\n
 No martyr is among ye now\n
 Whom you can call your own\n
 So go on your way accordingly\n
 But know you’re not alone”\n
 I dreamed I saw St. Augustine\n
 Alive with fiery breath\n
 And I dreamed I was amongst the ones\n
 That put him out to death\n
 Oh, I awoke in anger\n
 So alone and terrified\n
 I put my fingers against the glass\n
 And bowed my head and cried\n

        “There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief\n
 “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief\n
 Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth\n
 None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”\n
 “No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke\n
 “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke\n
 But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate\n
 So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”\n
 All along the watchtower, princes kept the view\n
 While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too\n
 Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl\n
 Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl\n

        Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\n
 They were the best of friends\n
 So when Frankie Lee needed money one day\n
 Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens\n
 And placed them on a footstool\n
 Just above the plotted plain\n
 Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy\n
 My loss will be your gain”\n
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down\n
 And put his fingers to his chin\n
 But with the cold eyes of Judas on him\n
 His head began to spin\n
 “Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said\n
 “It’s just my foolish pride\n
 But sometimes a man must be alone\n
 And this is no place to hide”\n
 Well, Judas, he just winked and said\n
 “All right, I’ll leave you here\n
 But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want\n
 Before they all disappear”\n
 “I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now\n
 Just tell me where you’ll be”\n
 Judas pointed down the road\n
 And said, “Eternity!”\n
 “Eternity?” said Frankie Lee\n
 With a voice as cold as ice\n
 “That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity\n
 Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”\n
 “I don’t call it anything”\n
 Said Frankie Lee with a smile\n
 “All right,” said Judas Priest\n
 “I’ll see you after a while”\n
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down\n
 Feelin’ low and mean\n
 When just then a passing stranger\n
 Burst upon the scene\n
 Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler\n
 Whose father is deceased?\n
 Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road\n
 And they say his name is Priest”\n
 “Oh, yes, he is my friend”\n
 Said Frankie Lee in fright\n
 “I do recall him very well\n
 In fact, he just left my sight”\n
 “Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger\n
 As quiet as a mouse\n
 “Well, my message is, he’s down the road\n
 Stranded in a house”\n
 Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked\n
 He dropped ev’rything and ran\n
 Until he came up to the spot\n
 Where Judas Priest did stand\n
 “What kind of house is this,” he said\n
 “Where I have come to roam?”\n
 “It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest\n
 “It’s not a house . . . it’s a home”\n
 Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled\n
 He soon lost all control\n
 Over ev’rything which he had made\n
 While the mission bells did toll\n
 He just stood there staring\n
 At that big house as bright as any sun\n
 With four and twenty windows\n
 And a woman’s face in ev’ry one\n
 Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\n
 With a soulful, bounding leap\n
 And, foaming at the mouth\n
 He began to make his midnight creep\n
 For sixteen nights and days he raved\n
 But on the seventeenth he burst\n
 Into the arms of Judas Priest\n
 Which is where he died of thirst\n
 No one tried to say a thing\n
 When they took him out in jest\n
 Except, of course, the little neighbor boy\n
 Who carried him to rest\n
 And he just walked along, alone\n
 With his guilt so well concealed\n
 And muttered underneath his breath\n
 “Nothing is revealed”\n
 Well, the moral of the story\n
 The moral of this song\n
 Is simply that one should never be\n
 Where one does not belong\n
 So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’\n
 Help him with his load\n
 And don’t go mistaking Paradise\n
 For that home across the road\n

        “Oh, help me in my weakness”\n
 I heard the drifter say\n
 As they carried him from the courtroom\n
 And were taking him away\n
 “My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one\n
 And my time it isn’t long\n
 And I still do not know\n
 What it was that I’ve done wrong”\n
 Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside\n
 A tear came to his eye\n
 “You fail to understand,” he said\n
 “Why must you even try?”\n
 Outside, the crowd was stirring\n
 You could hear it from the door\n
 Inside, the judge was stepping down\n
 While the jury cried for more\n
 “Oh, stop that cursed jury”\n
 Cried the attendant and the nurse\n
 “The trial was bad enough\n
 But this is ten times worse”\n
 Just then a bolt of lightning\n
 Struck the courthouse out of shape\n
 And while ev’rybody knelt to pray\n
 The drifter did escape\n

        Dear landlord\n
 Please don’t put a price on my soul\n
 My burden is heavy\n
 My dreams are beyond control\n
 When that steamboat whistle blows\n
 I’m gonna give you all I got to give\n
 And I do hope you receive it well\n
 Dependin’ on the way you feel that you live\n
 Dear landlord\n
 Please heed these words that I speak\n
 I know you’ve suffered much\n
 But in this you are not so unique\n
 All of us, at times, we might work too hard\n
 To have it too fast and too much\n
 And anyone can fill his life up\n
 With things he can see but he just cannot touch\n
 Dear landlord\n
 Please don’t dismiss my case\n
 I’m not about to argue\n
 I’m not about to move to no other place\n
 Now, each of us has his own special gift\n
 And you know this was meant to be true\n
 And if you don’t underestimate me\n
 I won’t underestimate you\n

        I am a lonesome hobo\n
 Without family or friends\n
 Where another man’s life might begin\n
 That’s exactly where mine ends\n
 I have tried my hand at bribery\n
 Blackmail and deceit\n
 And I’ve served time for ev’rything\n
 ’Cept beggin’ on the street\n
 Well, once I was rather prosperous\n
 There was nothing I did lack\n
 I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth\n
 And silk upon my back\n
 But I did not trust my brother\n
 I carried him to blame\n
 Which led me to my fatal doom\n
 To wander off in shame\n
 Kind ladies and kind gentlemen\n
 Soon I will be gone\n
 But let me just warn you all\n
 Before I do pass on\n
 Stay free from petty jealousies\n
 Live by no man’s code\n
 And hold your judgment for yourself\n
 Lest you wind up on this road\n

    I pity the poor immigrant\n
 Who wishes he would’ve stayed home\n
 Who uses all his power to do evil\n
 But in the end is always left so alone\n
 That man whom with his fingers cheats\n
 And who lies with ev’ry breath\n
 Who passionately hates his life\n
 And likewise, fears his death\n
 I pity the poor immigrant\n
 Whose strength is spent in vain\n
 Whose heaven is like Ironsides\n
 Whose tears are like rain\n
 Who eats but is not satisfied\n
 Who hears but does not see\n
 Who falls in love with wealth itself\n
 And turns his back on me\n
 I pity the poor immigrant\n
 Who tramples through the mud\n
 Who fills his mouth with laughing\n
 And who builds his town with blood\n
 Whose visions in the final end\n
 Must shatter like the glass\n
 I pity the poor immigrant\n
 When his gladness comes to pass\n

<string name="thewickedmessengerlyrics">
    There was a wicked messenger\n
 From Eli he did come\n
 With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter\n
 When questioned who had sent for him\n
 He answered with his thumb\n
 For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter\n
 He stayed behind the assembly hall\n
 It was there he made his bed\n
 Oftentimes he could be seen returning\n
 Until one day he just appeared\n
 With a note in his hand which read\n
 “The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”\n
 Oh, the leaves began to fallin’\n
 And the seas began to part\n
 And the people that confronted him were many\n
 And he was told but these few words\n
 Which opened up his heart\n
 “If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”\n

    Down along the cove\n
 I spied my true love comin’ my way\n
 Down along the cove\n
 I spied my true love comin’ my way\n
 I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama\n
 It sure is good to see you comin’ today"\nDown along the cove
 I spied my little bundle of joy
 Down along the cove
 I spied my little bundle of joy
 She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
 I’m so glad you’re my boy!”
 Down along the cove
 We walked together hand in hand
 Down along the cove
 We walked together hand in hand.
 Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by
 Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand

    Close your eyes, close the door\n
 You don’t have to worry anymore\n
 I’ll be your baby tonight\n
 Shut the light, shut the shade\n
 You don’t have to be afraid\n
 I’ll be your baby tonight\n
 Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away\n
 We’re gonna forget it\n
 That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon\n
 But we’re gonna let it\n
 You won’t regret it\n
 Kick your shoes off, do not fear\n
 Bring that bottle over here\n
 I’ll be your baby tonight\n
