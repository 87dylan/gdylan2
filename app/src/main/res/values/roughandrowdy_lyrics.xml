        Today and tomorrow and yesterday too\n
 The flowers are dying like all things do \n
 Follow me close - I’m going to Bally-Na-Lee\n
 I’ll lose my mind if you don’t come with me \n
 I fuss with my hair and I fight blood feuds .\n
        . . I contain multitudes\n
 Gotta tell tale heart like Mr. Poe\n
 Got skeletons in the walls of people you know \n
 I’ll drink to the truth of things that we said\n
 I’ll drink to the man that shares your bed\n
 I paint landscapes - I paint nudes . \n
        . . I contain multitudes\n
 A red Cadillac and a black moustache\n
 Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash\n
 Tell me what’s next - what shall we do \n
 Half my soul baby belongs to you \n
 I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes . \n
        . . I contain multitudes\n
 I’m just like Anne Frank - like Indiana Jones\n
 And them British bad boys the Rolling Stones\n
 I go right to the edge - I go right to the end \n
 I go right where all things lost - are made good again\n
 I sing the songs of experience like William Blake\n
 I have no apologies to make \n
 Everything’s flowin’ all at the same time \n
 I live on the boulevard of crime\n
 I drive fast cars and I eat fast foods . \n
        . . I contain multitudes\n
 Pink pedal pushers and red blue jeans \n
 All the pretty maids and all the old queens \n
 All the old queens from all my past lives\n
 I carry four pistols and two large knives\n
 I’m a man of contradictions and a man of many moods .\n
        . . I contain multitudes\n
 Greedy old wolf - I’ll show you my heart \n
 But not all of it - only the hateful part\n
 I’ll sell you down the river - I’ll put a price on your head\n
 What more can I tell ya - I sleep with life and death in the same bed\n
 Get lost Madam - get up off my knee\n
 Keep your mouth away from me \n
 I’ll keep the path open - the path in my mind \n
 I’ll see to it that there’s no love left behind\n
 I play Beethoven sonatas Chopin’s preludes . \n
        . . I contain multitudes\n

Another day without end \n
 another ship going out\n
 Another day of anger \n
 bitterness and doubt\n
 I know how it happened \n
 I saw it begin \n
 I opened my heart to the world\n
 and the world came in\
 Hello Mary Lou \n
 Hello Miss Pearl\n
 My fleet footed guides from the underworld \n
 No stars in the sky shine brighter than you \n
 You girls mean business and I do too \n
 I’m the enemy of treason \n
 the enemy of strife\n
 I’m the enemy of the unlived meaningless life\n
 I ain’t no false prophet \n
 I just know what I know\n
 I go where only the lonely can go\n
 I’m first among equals \n
 second to none \n
 I’m last of the best\n
 you can bury the rest\n
 Bury ‘em naked with their silver and gold\n
 Put ‘em six feet under and then pray for their souls\n
 What are you lookin’ at\n
 there’s nothing to see\n
 Just a cool breeze encircling me\n
 Let’s walk in the garden \n
 so far and so wide\n
 We can sit in the shade by the fountain side \n
 I’ve searched the world over for the Holy Grail\n
 I sing songs of love \n
 I sing songs of betrayal\n
 Don’t care what I drink \n
 don’t care what I eat\n
 I climbed a mountain of swords on my bare feet\n
 You don’t know me darlin’\n
 you never would guess\n
 I’m nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest\n
 I ain’t no false prophet \n
 I just said what I said\n
 I’m here to bring vengeance on somebody’s head\n
 Put out your hand \n
 there’s nothin’ to hold\n
 Open your mouth\n
 I’ll stuff it with gold\n
 Oh you poor Devil\n
 look up if you will \n
 The City of God is there on the hill\n
 Hello stranger\n
 Hello and goodbye \n
 You rule the land but so do I \n
 You lusty old mule\n
 you got a poisoned brain\n
 I’m gonna marry you to a ball and chain \n
 You know darlin’ the kind of life that I live\n
 When your smile meets my smile \n
 something’s got to give\n
 I ain’t no false prophet \n
 I’m nobody’s bride\n
 Can’t remember when I was born and I forgot when I died\n

<string name="myownversionofyoulyrics">
All through the summers and into January \n
 I’ve been visiting morgues and monasteries\n
 Looking for the necessary body parts\n
 Limbs and livers and brains and hearts \n
 I want to bring someone to life - is what I want to do\n
 I want to create my own version of you\n
 It must be the winter of my discontent \n
 I wish you’d taken me with you wherever you went \n
 They talk all night - they talk all day\n
 Not for a second do I believe what they say\n
 I want to bring someone to life - someone I’ve never seen \n
 You know what I mean - you know exactly what I mean\n
 I’ll take Scarface Pacino and the Godfather Brando\n
 Mix ‘em up in a tank and get a robot commando \n
 If I do it upright and put the head on straight\n
 I’ll be saved by the creature that I create\n
 I get blood from a cactus - make gunpowder from ice\n
 I don’t gamble with cards and I don’t shoot no dice\n
 Can you look in my face with your sightless eye\n
 Can you cross your heart and hope to die\n
 I’ll bring someone to life - someone for real\n
 Someone who feels the way that I feel\n
 I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind\n
 I want to do things for the benefit of all mankind\n
 I say to the willow tree - don’t weep for me\n
 I’m saying the hell with all things that used to be\n
 I get into trouble and I hit the wall \n
 No place to turn - no place at all\n
 I pick a number between one and two\n
 And I ask myself what would Julius Caesar do\n
 I’ll bring someone to life - in more ways than one \n
 Don’t matter how long it takes - it’ll be done when it’s done\n
 I’m gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell \n
 Like Liberace - like St. John the Apostle \n
 Play every number that I can play\n
 I’ll see you baby on Judgement Day\n
 After midnight if you still want to meet\n
 I’ll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street \n
 Two doors down not that far to walk \n
 I’ll hear your footsteps - you won’t have to knock\n
 I’ll bring someone to life - balance the scales\n
 I’m not gonna get involved in any insignificant details\n

 You can bring it to St. Peter - you can bring it to Jerome\n
 You can move it on over - bring it all the way home\n
 Bring it to the corner where the children play\n
 You can bring it to me on a silver tray\n

 I’ll bring someone to life - spare no expense\n
 Do it with decency and common sense\n
 Can you tell me what it means to be or not to be \n
 You won’t get away with fooling me \n
 Can you help me walk that moonlight mile \n
 Can you give me the blessings of your smile \n
 I want to bring someone to life - use all my powers\n
 Do it in the dark in the wee small hours\n
 I can see the history of the whole human race \n
 It’s all right there - its carved into your face \n
 Should I break it all down - should I fall on my knees\n
 Is there light at the end of the tunnel - can you tell me please\n
 Stand over there by the Cypress tree \n
 Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery \n
 Long ago before the First Crusade \n
 Way back before England or America were made\n
 Step right into the burning hell\n
 Where some of the best known enemies of mankind dwell\n
 Mister Freud with his dreams and Mister Marx with his axe\n
 See the raw hide lash rip the skin off their backs\n
 You got the right spirit - you can feel it you can hear it \n
 You got what they call the immortal spirit \n
 You can feel it all night you can feel it in the morn \n
 Creeps into your body the day you are born\n
 One strike of lightning is all that I need \n
 And a blast of ‘lectricity that runs at top speed \n
 Show me your ribs - I’ll stick in the knife\n
 I’m gonna jump start my creation to life \n
 I want to bring someone to life - turn back the years\n
 Do it with laughter - do it with tears\n

Sitting on my terrace lost in the stars\n
 Listenin’ to the sounds of the sad guitars\n
 Been thinking it over and I thought it all through\n
 I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you\n
 I saw the first fall of snow\n
 I saw the flowers come and go \n
 I don’t think anyone else ever knew\n
 I made up my mind to give myself to you\n
 I’m giving myself to you, I am\n
 From Salt Lake City to Birmingham\n
 From East L.A. to San Antone\n
 I don’t think I could bear to live my life alone\n
 My eye is like a shooting star\n
 It looks at nothing, neither near or far\n
 No one ever told me, it’s just something I knew\n
 I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you\n
 If I had the wings of a snow white dove\n
 I’d preach the gospel, the gospel of love \n
 A love so real - a love so true\n
 I made up my mind to give myself to you \n
 Take me out traveling, you’re a traveling man \n
 Show me something that I’ll understand \n
 I’m not what I was, things aren’t what they were\n
 I’m going to go far away from home with her\n
 I traveled the long road of despair\n
 I met no other traveler there\n
 A lot of people gone, a lot of people I knew\n
 I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you \n
 My heart’s like a river - a river that sings\n
 It just takes me a while to realize things\n
 I’ll see you at sunrise - I’ll see you at dawn\n
 I’ll lay down beside you, when everyone is gone\n
 From the plains and the prairies - from the mountains to the sea\n
 I hope that the gods go easy with me \n
 I knew you’d say yes - I’m saying it too\n
 I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you\n

Black Rider Black Rider you been livin’ too hard\n
 You been up all night havin’ to stay on your guard \n
 The path that you’re walkin’ - is too narrow to walk\n
 Every step of the way another stumblin’ block \n
 The road that you’re on - same road that you know \n
 But it’s not the same as - it was a minute ago\n
 Black Rider Black Rider you’ve seen it all \n
 You’ve seen the great world and you’ve seen the small\n
 You fell into the fire and you’re eating the flame\n
 Better seal up your lips if you want to stay in the game \n
 Be reasonable Mister - be honest be fair\n
 Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer\n
 Black Rider Black Rider all dressed in black\n
 I’m walking away and you try to make me look back\n
 My heart is at rest I’d like to keep it that way\n
 I don’t want to fight - at least not today\n
 Go home to your wife stop visiting mine \n
 One of these days I’ll forget to be kind \n
 Black Rider Black Rider tell me when - tell me how\n
 If there ever was a time then let it be now \n
 Let me go through - open the door\n
 My soul is distressed my mind is at war \n
 Don’t hug me - don’t flatter me - don’t turn on the charm \n
 I’ll take out a sword and have to hack off your arm \n
 Black Rider Black Rider hold it right there\n
 The size of your cock will get you nowhere\n
 I’ll suffer in silence I’ll not make a sound \n
 Maybe I’ll take the - high moral ground \n
 Some enchanted evening I’ll sing you a song\n
 Black Rider Black Rider you’ve been on the job too long\n

I live on a street named after a Saint\n
 Women in the churches wear powder and paint\n
 Where the Jews and the Catholics and the Muslims all pray\n
 I can tell a Proddy from a mile away\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed - Jimmy Reed indeed\n
 Give me that old time religion, it’s just what I need\n
 For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory\n
 Go tell it on the Mountain, go tell the real story\n
 Tell it in that straight forward puritanical tone\n
 In the mystic hours when a person’s alone\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed - Godspeed\n
 Thump on the bible - proclaim the creed\n
 You won’t amount to much the people all said\n
 ‘Cause I didn’t play guitar behind my head\n
 Never pandered never acted proud\n
 Never took off my shoes and threw them into the crowd\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed - goodbye and goodnight\n
 I’ll put a jewel in your crown - I’ll put out the light\n
 They threw everything at me, everything in the book\n
 Had nothing to fight with but a butcher’s hook\n
 They have no pity - they don’t lend a hand\n
 And I can’t sing a song that I don’t understand\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed - goodbye and good luck\n
 Can’t play the record ‘cause my needle got stuck\n
 Transparent woman in a transparent dress\n
 It suits you well - I must confess\n
 I’ll break open your grapes I’ll suck out the juice\n
 I need you like my head needs a noose\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long\n
 I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong\n
 G-d be with you, brother dear\n
 If you don’t mind me asking, what brings you here?\n
 Oh, nothing much, I’m just looking for the man\n
 I came to see where he’s lying in this lost land\n
 Goodbye Jimmy Reed and with everything within ya\n
 Can’t you hear me calling from down in Virginia\n

Mother of Muses sing for me\n
 Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea\n
 Sing of the lakes and the nymphs in the forest\n
 Sing your hearts out - all you women of the chorus\n
 Sing of honor and fame and of glory be \n
 Mother of Muses, sing for me \n
 Mother of Muses sing for my heart\n
 Sing for a love too soon to depart\n
 Sing of the Heroes who stood alone \n
 Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone\n
 Who struggled with pain so the world could go free\n
 Mother of Muses, sing for me \n
 Sing of Sherman - Montgomery and Scott\n
 Sing of Zhukov and Patton and the battles they fought\n
 Who cleared the path for Presley to sing \n
 Who carved out the path for Martin Luther King\n
 Who did what they did and then went on their way \n
 Man, I could tell their stories all day \n
 I’m falling in love with Calliope \n
 She doesn’t belong to anybody - why not give her to me\n
 She’s speaking to me, speaking with her eyes \n
 I’ve grown so tired of chasing lies\n
 Mother of Muses wherever you are \n
 I’ve already outlived my life by far\n
 Mother of Muses unleash your wrath\n
 Things I can’t see - they’re blocking my path\n
 Show me your wisdom - tell me my fate \n
 Put me upright - make me walk straight \n
 Forge my identity from the inside out \n
 You know what I’m talking about\n
 Take me to the river and release your charms \n
 Let me lay down in your sweet lovin’ arms\n
 Wake me - shake me - free me from sin\n
 Make me invisible like the wind \n
 Got a mind to ramble - got a mind to roam\n
 I’m travelin’ light and I’m slow coming home\n

I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day of the most dangerous month of the year\n
 At the worst time at the worst place - that’s all I seem to hear\n
 I got up early so I could greet the Goddess of the Dawn \n
 I painted my wagon - I abandoned all hope and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 The Rubicon is the Red River, going gently as she flows\n
 Redder then your ruby lips and the blood that flows from the rose\n
 Three miles north of purgatory - one step from the great beyond\n
 I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 What are these dark days I see in this world so badly bent\n
 How can I redeem the time - the time so idly spent\n
 How much longer can it last - how long can this go on\n
 I embraced my love put down my head and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 I feel the bones beneath my skin and they’re tremblin’ with rage\n
 I’ll make your wife a widow - you’ll never see old age \n
 Show me one good man in sight that the sun shines down upon\n
 I pawned my watch and I paid my debts and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 Put my heart upon the hill where some happiness I’ll find\n
 If I survive then let me love - let the hour be mine\n
 Take the high road - take the low, take the one you’re on \n
 I poured the cup and I passed it along and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 You defiled the most lovely flower in all of womanhood\n
 Others can be tolerant - others can be good\n
 I’ll cut you up with a crooked knife and I’ll miss you when you’re gone\n
 I stood between heaven and earth and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 You won’t find any happiness here - no happiness or joy\n
 Go back to the gutter and try your luck - find you some nice young pretty boy\n
 Tell me how many men I need and who I can count upon\n
 I strapped my belt and buttoned my coat and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 I feel the Holy Spirit inside and see the light that freedom gives\n
 I believe it’s within the reach of every man who lives\n
 Keep as far away as possible - it’s darkest ‘fore the dawn \n
 I turned the key and I broke it off and I crossed the Rubicon\n
 Mona Baby, are you still in my mind - I truly believe that you are\n
 Couldn’t be anybody else but you who’s come with me this far \n
 The killing frost is on the ground and the autumn leaves are gone\n
 I lit the torch and I looked to the east and I crossed the Rubicon\n

McKinley hollered - McKinley squalled \n
 Doctor said McKinley - death is on the wall\n
 Say it to me if you got something to confess\n
 I heard all about it - he was going down slow\n
 Heard it on the wireless radio\n
 From down in the boondocks - way down in Key West\n
 I’m searchin’ for love and inspiration \n
 On that pirate radio station\n
 It’s comin’ out of Luxembourg and Budapest\n
 Radio signal clear as can be\n
 I’m so deep in love I can hardly see\n
 Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West\n
 Key West is the place to be \n
 If you’re lookin’ for immortality\n
 Stay on the road – follow the highway sign\n
 Key West is fine and fair\n
 If you lost your mind, you’ll find it there\n
 Key West is on the horizon line \
 I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track\n
 Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac \n
 Like Louie and Jimmy and Buddy and all of the rest\n
 It might not be the thing to do \n
 But I’m stickin’ with you through and through\n
 Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West\n
 I got both my feet planted square on the ground\n
 Got my right hand high with the thumb down\n
 Such is life - such is happiness\n
 Hibiscus flowers grow everywhere here\n
 If you wear one put it behind your ear\n
 Down on the bottom - way down in Key West\n
 Key West is the place to go\n
 Down by the Gulf of Mexico\n
 Beyond the sea - beyond the shifting sand\n
 Key West is the gateway key\n
 To innocence and purity\n
 Key West - Key West is the enchanted land \n
 I’ve never lived in the land of Oz\n
 Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause\n
 It’s hot down here and you can’t be overdressed \n
 The tiny blossoms of a toxic plant\n
 They can make you dizzy - I’d like to help ya but I can’t \n
 Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West\n
 The fishtail ponds and the orchid trees\n
 They can give you the bleedin’ heart disease\n
 People tell me - I oughta try a little tenderness\n
 Amelia Street - Bay View Park \n
 Walkin’ in the shadows after dark \n
 Down under - way down in Key West\n
 I play the gumbo limbo spirituals\n
 I know all the Hindu rituals\n
 People tell me that I’m truly blessed\n
 Bougainvillea bloomin’ in the summer and spring \n
 Winter here is an unknown thing\n
 Down the flatlands - way down in Key West\n
 Key West is under the sun\n
 Under the radar - under the gun\n
 You stay to the left and then you lean to the right\n
 Feel the sunlight on your skin\n
 And the healing virtues of the wind\n
 Key West - Key West is the land of light \n
 Wherever I travel - wherever I roam \n
 I’m not that far from the convent home\n
 I do what I think is right - what I think is best\n
 Mystery Street off Mallory Square\n
 Truman had his White House there\n
 Eastbound - westbound \n
 Way down in Key West\n
 Twelve years old and they put me in a suit\n
 Forced me to marry a prostitute\n
 There were gold fringes on her wedding dress\n
 That’s my story but not where it ends\n
 She’s still cute and we’re still friends\n
 Down in the bottom - way down in Key West\n
 I play both sides against the middle\n
 Pickin’ up that pirate radio signal\n
 I heard the news - I heard your last request\n
 Fly around my Pretty Little Miss\n
 I don’t love nobody - gimme a kiss \n
 Down at the bottom - way down in Key West\n
 Key West is the place to be\n
 If you’re lookin’ for immortality\n
 Key West is paradise divine \n
 Key West is fine and fair\n
 If you lost your mind you’ll find it there\n
 Key West is on the horizon line\n

‘Twas a dark day in Dallas - November ‘63\n
 The day that will live on in infamy\n
 President Kennedy was riding high \n
 A good day to be living and a good day to die\n
 Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb\n
 Say wait a minute boys, do you know who I am?\n
 Of course we do, we know who you are\n
 Then they blew off his head when he was still in the car\n
 Shot down like a dog in broad daylight\n
 ‘Twas a matter of timing and the timing was right\n
 You got unpaid debts and we’ve come to collect\n
 We’re gon’ kill you with hatred and without any respect \n
 We’ll mock you and shock you, we’ll grin in your face\n
 We’ve already got someone here to take your place\n
 The day that they blew out the brains of the king\n
 Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing\n
 It happened so quickly - so quick by surprise\n
 Right there in front of everyone’s eyes\n
 Greatest magic trick ever under the sun\n
 Perfectly executed, skillfully done\n
 Wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman, howl\n
 Rub a dub dub – it’s murder most foul\n
 Hush lil children, you’ll soon understand\n
 The Beatles are coming they’re gonna hold your hand\n
 Slide down the banister, go get your coat\n
 Ferry ‘cross the Mersey and go for the throat\n
 There’s three bums comin’ all dressed in rags\n
 Pick up the pieces and lower the flags\n
 I’m going to Woodstock, it’s the Aquarian Age\n
 Then I’ll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage\n
 Put your head out the window, let the good times roll\n
 There’s a party going on behind the grassy knoll\n
 Stack up the bricks and pour the cement\n
 Don’t say Dallas don’t love you, Mr. President\n
 Put your foot in the tank and step on the gas\n
 Try to make it to the triple underpass\n
 Black face singer - white face clown\n
 Better not show your faces after the sun goes down\n
 I’m in the red-light district like a cop on the beat\n
 Living in a nightmare on Elm Street\n
 When you’re down on Deep Ellum put your money in your shoe\n
 Don’t ask what your country can do for you\n
 Cash on the barrel head, money to burn\n
 Dealey Plaza, make a left hand turn\n
 Go down to the crossroads, try to flag a ride\n
 That’s the place where Faith, Hope and Charity died\n
 Shoot ‘em while he runs, boy, shoot ‘em while you can\n
 See if you can shoot the Invisible Man\n
 Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye Uncle Sam Frankly,\n
 Miss Scarlet, I don’t give a damn\n
 What is the truth and where did it go\n
 Ask Oswald and Ruby - they oughta know\n
 Shut your mouth, says the wise old owl\n
 Business is business and it’s murder most foul\n
 Tommy can you hear me, I’m the Acid Queen\n
 I’m ridin’ in a long black Lincoln limousine\n
 Ridin’ in the back seat, next to my wife\n
 Heading straight on into the afterlife\n
 I’m leaning to the left, got my head in her lap\n
 Oh Lord, I’ve been led into some kind of a trap\n
 We ask no quarter, no quarter do we give\n
 We’re right down the street from the street where you live\n
 They mutilated his body and took out his brain\n
 What more could they do, they piled on the pain\n
 But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at\n
 For the last fifty years they’ve been searching for that\n
 Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me\n
 Hate to tell you, Mister, but only dead men are free\n
 Send me some loving - tell me no lie\n
 Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by\n
 Wake up, Little Suzie, let’s go for a drive\n
 Cross the Trinity River, let’s keep hope alive\n
 Turn the radio on, don’t touch the dials\n
 Parkland Hospital’s only six more miles\n
 You got me dizzy Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead\n
 That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head\n
 I’m just a patsy like Patsy Cline\n
 I never shot anyone from in front or behind\n
 Got blood in my eyes, got blood in my ear\n
 I’m never gonna make it to the New Frontier\n
 Zapruder’s film, I’ve seen that before\n
 Seen it thirty three times, maybe more\n
 It’s vile and deceitful - it’s cruel and it’s mean\n
 Ugliest thing that you ever have seen \n
 They killed him once, they killed him twice\n
 Killed him like a human sacrifice\n
 The day that they killed him, someone said to me, \n
    “Son, The age of the anti-Christ has just only begun.”\n
 Air Force One coming in through the gate\n
 Johnson sworn in at two thirty-eight \n
 Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel\n
 It is what it is and it’s murder most foul\n
 What’s New Pussycat - wha’d I say\n
 I said the soul of a nation been torn away\n
 It’s beginning to go down into a slow decay \n
 And that it’s thirty-six hours past judgment day\n
 Wolfman Jack, he’s speaking in tongues\n
 He’s going on and on at the top of his lungs\n
 Play me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack\n
 Play it for me in my long Cadillac\n
 Play that Only The Good Die Young\n
 Take me to the place where Tom Dooley was hung\n
 Play St. James Infirmary in the court of King James\n
 If you want to remember, better write down the names \n
 Play Etta James too, play I’d Rather Go Blind\n
 Play it for the man with the telepathic mind\n
 Play John Lee Hooker play Scratch My Back\n
 Play it for that strip club owner named Jack\n
 Guitar Slim - Goin’ Down Slow\n
 Play it for me and for Marilyn Monroe \n
 And please, Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood \n
 Play it for the First Lady, she ain’t feeling that good \n
 Play Don Henley - play Glenn Frey\n
 Take it to the Limit and let it go by\n
 And play it for Carl Wilson, too\n
 Lookin’ far, far away down Gower Avenue \n
 Play Tragedy, play Twilight Time \n
 Take Me Back to Tulsa to the scene of the crime\n
 Play another one and Another One Bites the Dust \n
 Play the Old Rugged Cross and in G-d We Trust\n
 Ride the Pink Horse down that Long, Lonesome Road\n
 Stand there and wait for his head to explode\n
 Play Mystery Train for Mr. Mystery\n
 The man who fell down dead, like a rootless tree\n
 Play it for the Reverend, play it for the Pastor\n
