Come gather ’round people\n
 Wherever you roam\n
 And admit that the waters\n
 Around you have grown\n
 And accept it that soon\n
 You’ll be drenched to the bone\n
 If your time to you is worth savin’\n
 Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone\n
 For the times they are a-changin’\n

 Come writers and critics\n
 Who prophesize with your pen\n
 And keep your eyes wide\n
 The chance won’t come again\n
 And don’t speak too soon\n
 For the wheel’s still in spin\nb
 And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’\n
 For the loser now will be later to win\n
 For the times they are a-changin’\n

 Come senators, congressmen\n
 Please heed the call\n
 Don’t stand in the doorway\n
 Don’t block up the hall\n
 For he that gets hurt\n
 Will be he who has stalled\n
 There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’\n
 It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls\n
 For the times they are a-changin’\n

 Come mothers and fathers\n
 Throughout the land\n
 And don’t criticize\n
 What you can’t understand\n
 Your sons and your daughters\n
 Are beyond your command\n
 Your old road is rapidly agin’\n
 Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand\n
 For the times they are a-changin’\n

 The line it is drawn\n
 The curse it is cast\n
 The slow one now\n
 Will later be fast\n
 As the present now\n
 Will later be past\n
 The order is rapidly fadin’\n
 And the first one now will later be last\n
 For the times they are a-changin’\n

 He lived on the outside of town\n
 Hollis Brown\n
 He lived on the outside of town\n
 With his wife and five children\n
 And his cabin fallin’ down\n

 You looked for work and money\n
 And you walked a rugged mile\n
 You looked for work and money\n
 And you walked a rugged mile\n
 Your children are so hungry\n
 That they don’t know how to smile\n

 Your baby’s eyes look crazy\n
 They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve\n
 Your baby’s eyes look crazy\n
 They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve\n
 You walk the floor and wonder why\n
 With every breath you breathe\n

 The rats have got your flour\n
 Bad blood it got your mare\n
 The rats have got your flour\n
 Bad blood it got your mare\n
 If there’s anyone that knows\n
 Is there anyone that cares?\n

 You prayed to the Lord above\n
 Oh please send you a friend\n
 You prayed to the Lord above\n
 Oh please send you a friend\n
 Your empty pockets tell yuh\n
 That you ain’t a-got no friend\n

 Your babies are crying louder\n
 It’s pounding on your brain\n
 Your babies are crying louder now\n
 It’s pounding on your brain\n
 Your wife’s screams are stabbin’ you\n
 Like the dirty drivin’ rain\n

 Your grass it is turning black\n
 There’s no water in your well\n
 Your grass is turning black\n
 There’s no water in your well\n
 You spent your last lone dollar\n
 On seven shotgun shells\n

 Way out in the wilderness\n
 A cold coyote calls\n
 Way out in the wilderness\n
 A cold coyote calls\n
 Your eyes fix on the shotgun\n
 That’s hangin’ on the wall\n

 Your brain is a-bleedin’\n
 And your legs can’t seem to stand\n
 Your brain is a-bleedin’\n
 And your legs can’t seem to stand\n
 Your eyes fix on the shotgun\n
 That you’re holdin’ in your hand\n

 There’s seven breezes a-blowin’\n
 All around the cabin door\n
 There’s seven breezes a-blowin’\n
 All around the cabin door\n
 Seven shots ring out\n
 Like the ocean’s pounding roar\n

 There’s seven people dead\n
 On a South Dakota farm\n
 There’s seven people dead\n
 On a South Dakota farm\n
 Somewhere in the distance\n
 There’s seven new people born\n

        Oh my name it is nothin’\n
 My age it means less\n
 The country I come from\n
 Is called the Midwest\n
 I’s taught and brought up there\n
 The laws to abide\n
 And that the land that I live in\n
 Has God on its side\n

 Oh the history books tell it\n
 They tell it so well\n
 The cavalries charged\n
 The Indians fell\n
 The cavalries charged\n
 The Indians died\n
 Oh the country was young\n
 With God on its side\n

 Oh the Spanish-American\n
 War had its day\n
 And the Civil War too\n
 Was soon laid away\n
 And the names of the heroes\n
 l’s made to memorize\n
 With guns in their hands\n
 And God on their side\n

 Oh the First World War, boys\n
 It closed out its fate\n
 The reason for fighting\n
 I never got straight\n
 But I learned to accept it\n
 Accept it with pride\n
 For you don’t count the dead\n
 When God’s on your side\n

 When the Second World War\n
 Came to an end\n
 We forgave the Germans\n
 And we were friends\n
 Though they murdered six million\n
 In the ovens they fried\n
 The Germans now too\n
 Have God on their side\n

 I’ve learned to hate Russians\n
 All through my whole life\n
 If another war starts\n
 It’s them we must fight\n
 To hate them and fear them\n
 To run and to hide\n
 And accept it all bravely\n
 With God on my side\n

 But now we got weapons\n
 Of the chemical dust\n
 If fire them we’re forced to\n
 Then fire them we must\n
 One push of the button\n
 And a shot the world wide\n
 And you never ask questions\n
 When God’s on your side\n

 Through many dark hour\n
 I’ve been thinkin’ about this\n
 That Jesus Christ\n
 Was betrayed by a kiss\n
 But I can’t think for you\n
 You’ll have to decide\n
 Whether Judas Iscariot\n
 Had God on his side\n

 So now as I’m leavin’\n
 I’m weary as Hell\n
 The confusion I’m feelin’\n
 Ain’t no tongue can tell\n
 The words fill my head\n
 And fall to the floor\n
 If God’s on our side\n
 He’ll stop the next war\n

        Down the street the dogs are barkin’\n
 And the day is a-gettin’ dark\n
 As the night comes in a-fallin’\n
 The dogs’ll lose their bark\n
 An’ the silent night will shatter\n
 From the sounds inside my mind\n
 For I’m one too many mornings\n
 And a thousand miles behind\n

 From the crossroads of my doorstep\n
 My eyes they start to fade\n
 As I turn my head back to the room\n
 Where my love and I have laid\n
 An’ I gaze back to the street\n
 The sidewalk and the sign\n
 And I’m one too many mornings\n
 An’ a thousand miles behind\n

 It’s a restless hungry feeling\n
 That don’t mean no one no good\n
 When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’\n
 You can say it just as good.\n
 You’re right from your side\n
 I’m right from mine\n
 We’re both just one too many mornings\n
 An’ a thousand miles behind\n

        Come gather ’round friends\n
 And I’ll tell you a tale\n
 Of when the red iron pits ran plenty\n
 But the cardboard filled windows\n
 And old men on the benches\n
 Tell you now that the whole town is empty\n

 In the north end of town\n
 My own children are grown\n
 But I was raised on the other\n
 In the wee hours of youth\n
 My mother took sick\n
 And I was brought up by my brother\n

 The iron ore poured\n
 As the years passed the door\n
 The drag lines an’ the shovels they was a-humming \n
 ’Til one day my brother\n
 Failed to come home\n
 The same as my father before him\n

 Well a long winter’s wait\n
 From the window I watched\n
 My friends they couldn’t have been kinder And my schooling was cut\n
 As I quit in the spring\n
 To marry John Thomas, a miner\n

 Oh the years passed again\n
 And the givin’ was good\n
 With the lunch bucket filled every season\n
 What with three babies born\n
 The work was cut down\n
 To a half a day’s shift with no reason\n
 Then the shaft was soon shut\n
 And more work was cut\n
 And the fire in the air, it felt frozen \n
 ’Til a man come to speak\n
 And he said in one week\n
 That number eleven was closin’\n

 They complained in the East\n
 They are paying too high\n
 They say that your ore ain’t worth digging \n
 That it’s much cheaper down\n
 In the South American towns\n
 Where the miners work almost for nothing\n

 So the mining gates locked\n
 And the red iron rotted\n
 And the room smelled heavy from drinking \n
 Where the sad, silent song\n
 Made the hour twice as long\n
 As I waited for the sun to go sinking\n

 I lived by the window\n
 As he talked to himself\n
 This silence of tongues it was building \n
 Then one morning’s wake\n
 The bed it was bare\n
 And I’s left alone with three children\n

 The summer is gone\n
 The ground’s turning cold\n
 The stores one by one they’re a-foldin’\n
 My children will go\n
 As soon as they grow\n
 Well, there ain’t nothing here now to hold them\n

        A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood\n
 A finger fired the trigger to his name\n
 A handle hid out in the dark\n
 A hand set the spark\n
 Two eyes took the aim\n
 Behind a man’s brain\n
 But he can’t be blamed\n
 He’s only a pawn in their game\n

 A South politician preaches to the poor white man\n
 “You got more than the blacks, don’t complain\n
 You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain.\n
 And the Negro’s name\n
 Is used it is plain\n
 For the politician’s gain\n
 As he rises to fame\n
 And the poor white remains\n
 On the caboose of the train\n
 But it ain’t him to blame\n
 He’s only a pawn in their game\n

 The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid\n
 And the marshals and cops get the same\n
 But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool\n
 He’s taught in his school\n
 From the start by the rule\n
 That the laws are with him\n
 To protect his white skin\n
 To keep up his hate\n
 So he never thinks straight\n
 ’Bout the shape that he’s in\n
 But it ain’t him to blame\n
 He’s only a pawn in their game\n

 From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks\n
 And the hoofbeats pound in his brain\n
 And he’s taught how to walk in a pack\n
 Shoot in the back\n
 With his fist in a clinch\n
 To hang and to lynch\n
 To hide ’neath the hood\n
 To kill with no pain\n
 Like a dog on a chain\n
 He ain’t got no name\n
 But it ain’t him to blame\n
 He’s only a pawn in their game.\n

 Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught\n
 They lowered him down as a king\n
 But when the shadowy sun sets on the one\n
 That fired the gun\n
 He’ll see by his grave\n
 On the stone that remains\n
 Carved next to his name\n
 His epitaph plain:\n
 Only a pawn in their game\n

  Oh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love\n
 I’m sailin’ away in the morning\n
 Is there something I can send you from across the sea\n
 From the place that I’ll be landing?\n

 No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love\n
 There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’\n
 Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled\n
 From across that lonesome ocean\n

 Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine\n
 Made of silver or of golden\n
 Either from the mountains of Madrid\n
 Or from the coast of Barcelona\n

 Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night\n
 And the diamonds from the deepest ocean\n
 I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss\n
 For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’\n

 That I might be gone a long time\n
 And it’s only that I’m askin’\n
 Is there something I can send you to remember me by\n
 To make your time more easy passin’\n

 Oh, how can, how can you ask me again\n
 It only brings me sorrow\n
 The same thing I want from you today\n
 I would want again tomorrow\n

 I got a letter on a lonesome day\n
 It was from her ship a-sailin’\n
 Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again\n
 It depends on how I’m a-feelin’\n

 Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way\n
 I’m sure your mind is roamin’\n
 I’m sure your heart is not with me\n
 But with the country to where you’re goin’\n

 So take heed, take heed of the western wind\n
 Take heed of the stormy weather\n
 And yes, there’s something you can send back to me\n
 Spanish boots of Spanish leather\n

Oh the time will come up\n
 When the winds will stop\n
 And the breeze will cease to be breathin’\n
 Like the stillness in the wind\n
 ’Fore the hurricane begins\n
 The hour when the ship comes in\n

 Oh the seas will split\n
 And the ship will hit\n
 And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking\n
 Then the tide will sound\n
 And the wind will pound\n
 And the morning will be breaking\n

 Oh the fishes will laugh\n
 As they swim out of the path\n
 And the seagulls they’ll be smiling\n
 And the rocks on the sand\n
 Will proudly stand\n
 The hour that the ship comes in\n

 And the words that are used\n
 For to get the ship confused\n
 Will not be understood as they’re spoken\n
 For the chains of the sea\n
 Will have busted in the night\n
 And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean\n
 A song will lift\n
 As the mainsail shifts\n
 And the boat drifts on to the shoreline\n
 And the sun will respect\n
 Every face on the deck\n
 The hour that the ship comes in\n

 Then the sands will roll\n
 Out a carpet of gold\n
 For your weary toes to be a-touchin’\n
 And the ship’s wise men\n
 Will remind you once again\n
 That the whole wide world is watchin’\n

 Oh the foes will rise\n
 With the sleep still in their eyes\n
 And they’ll jerk from their beds and think they’re dreamin’\n
 But they’ll pinch themselves and squeal\n
 And know that it’s for real\n
 The hour when the ship comes in\n

 Then they’ll raise their hands\n
 Sayin’ we’ll meet all your demands\n
 But we’ll shout from the bow your days are numbered\n
 And like Pharoah’s tribe\n
 They’ll be drownded in the tide\n
 And like Goliath, they’ll be conquered\n

William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll\n
 With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger\n
 At a Baltimore hotel society gath’rin’\n
 And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him\n
 As they rode him in custody down to the station\n
 And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder\n
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears\n
 Take the rag away from your face\n
 Now ain’t the time for your tears\n
 William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years\n
 Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres\n
 With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him\n
 And high office relations in the politics of Maryland\n
 Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders\n
 And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling\n
 In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking\n
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears\n
 Take the rag away from your face\n
 Now ain’t the time for your tears\n

 Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen\n
 She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children\n
 Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage\n
 And never sat once at the head of the table\n
 And didn’t even talk to the people at the table\n
 Who just cleaned up all the food from the table\n
 And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level\n
 Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane\n
 That sailed through the air and came down through the room\n
 Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle\n
 And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger\n
 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears\n
 Take the rag away from your face\n
 Now ain’t the time for your tears\n

 In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel\n
 To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level\n
 And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded\n
 And that even the nobles get properly handled\n
 Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em\n
 And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom\n
 Stared at the person who killed for no reason\n
 Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’\n
 And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished\n
 And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance\n
 William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence\n
 Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears\n
 Bury the rag deep in your face\n
 For now’s the time for your tears\n

        Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend\n
 Be it mine right or wrongfully\n
 I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends\n
 To tie up the time most forcefully\n
 But the bottles are done\n
 We’ve killed each one\n
 And the table’s full and overflowed\n
 And the corner sign\n
 Says it’s closing time\n
 So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road\n

 Oh ev’ry girl that ever I’ve touched\n
 I did not do it harmfully\n
 And ev’ry girl that ever I’ve hurt\n
 I did not do it knowin’ly\n
 But to remain as friends\n
 And make amends\n
 You need the time and stay behind\n
 And since my feet are now fast\n
 And point away from the past\n
 I’ll bid farewell and be down the line\n

 Oh ev’ry foe that ever I faced\n
 The cause was there before we came\n
 And ev’ry cause that ever I fought\n
 I fought it full without regret or shame\n
 But the dark does die\n
 As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes\n
 Must meet the dawn\n
 And if I see the day\n
 I’d only have to stay\n
 So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone\n

 Oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind\n
 I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung\n
 But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes\n
 It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung\n
 But the time ain’t tall, yet on time you depend\n
 And no word is possessed by no special friend\n
 And though the line is cut\n
 It ain’t quite the end\n
 I’ll just bid farewell till we meet again\n

 Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time\n
 To disgrace, distract, and bother me\n
 And the dirt of gossip blows into my face\n
 And the dust of rumors covers me\n
 But if the arrow is straight\n
 And the point is slick\n
 It can pierce through dust no matter how thick\n
 So I’ll make my stand\n
 And remain as I am\n
 And bid farewell and not give a damn\n
